<h2 id="8-Value-Function-Approximation"><a href="#8-Value-Function-Approximation" class="headerlink" title="8  Value Function Approximation"></a>8  Value Function Approximation</h2><p>we continue to study temporal-difference learning algorithms. However, a different method is used to represent state/action values. The tabular method(Q-learning) is straight forward to understand, but it is <strong>inefficient for handling large state or action spaces.</strong> To solve this problem, this chapter introduces the function approximation method, which has become <strong>the standard way to represent values.</strong> It is also where <u>artificial neural networks are incorporated into reinforcement learning as function approximates</u>. The idea of function approximation can also be extended from representing values to representing policies, as introduced in Chapter 9.</p>

<p><strong>efficient:</strong> The function approximation method is only need to store a lower dimensional parameter vector $w$. however, not free. It comes with a cost: the state values may not be accurately represented by the function.</p>
<p><strong>generalization ability:</strong>  When using the tabular method, we can update<br> a value if the corresponding state is visited in an episode. The values of the states that have not been visited cannot be updated. However, when using the function approximation method, we need to update $w$ to update the value of a state. The update of $w$ also affects the values of some other states even though these states have not been visited. Therefore, the experience sample for one state can generalize to help estimate the values of some other states. The above analysis is illustrated in blow Figure.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-29-21-57-50.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can use more complex functions that have stronger approximation abilities than straight lines. For example, consider a second-order polynomial:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\hat{v}(s,w) = as^2+bs+c=\underbrace{[s^2,s,1]}_{\phi^T(s)}\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} a  \\ b  \\ c  \\ \end{bmatrix}}_{w}= \phi^T(s)w.
\tag{8.2}</script><p>Note that $\hat{v}(s,w)$ in either (1) or (2) is linear in $w$ (though it may be nonlinear in $s$). This type of method is called <strong>linear function approximation</strong>, which is the simplest function approximation method. To realize linear function approximation, <strong>The basis is to select an appropriate feature vector $\phi(s)$</strong>.  It requires prior knowledge of the given task: the better we understand the task, the better the feature vectors we can select. However, such prior knowledge is usually unknown in practice. <strong>If we do not have any prior knowledge,a popular solution is to use artificial neural networks as nonlinear function approximations.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>The chapter’s key is how to find the optimal parameter vector $w$.</strong>. If we know $v_{\pi}(s_i)$(the real value), this is a <strong>least-squares problem</strong>. The optimal parameter can be obtained by optimizing the following objective function:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">

Therefore,this section is the foundation of section 8.3.</p>
<p><em>Key core of this chapter：</em><u>**How to find the optimal parameter vector $w$?</u> == <u>How to update the state/action value?**</u><br>The function approximation method is formulated as an optimization problem.<br>(1) The objective function of this problem is introduced in Section 8.2.1 <strong>(the loss function)</strong>.<br>(2) The TD learning algorithm for optimizing this objective function is introduced in Section 8.2.2. <strong>(the optimal algorithm:SGD and TD learning algorithm)</strong><br>(3) There are two ways to formulate value function $\hat{v}(s,w)$/$\hat{q}(s,a,w)$ <strong>(formulate affine model)</strong>. </p>

<li>3.1) TD-Linear: use a linear function,we need to select appropriate feature vectors. (Section 8.2.3: the based TD algorithm; section 8.3: sarsa\Q-learning); </li>
<li>3.2) Artificial neural network as a nonlinear function approximate (Section 8.4: DQN).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8-2-1-Objective-function"><a href="#8-2-1-Objective-function" class="headerlink" title="8.2.1 Objective function"></a>8.2.1 Objective function</h4><p>The problem to be solved is to find an <em>optimal</em> $w$ so that $\hat{v}(s,w)$ can best approximate $v_{\pi}(s)$ for every s. In particular, the objective function is </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
J(w) =\mathbf{E}[(v_{\pi}(S)-\hat{v}(S,w))^2]
\tag{8.3}</script><p>While $S$ is a random variable, what is its probability distribution? There are several ways to define the probability distribution of $S$:</p>
<p>(1) The first way is to use a <strong>uniform distribution</strong>：(setting the probability of each state to $1/n$.)</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
J(w) =\mathbf{E}[(v_{\pi}(S)-\hat{v}(S,w))^2]= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{s \in S}(v_{\pi}(s)-\hat{v}(s,w))^2</script><p>which is the average value of the approximation errors of all the states. However, this way does not consider the real dynamics of the Markov process under the given policy. <u>Since some states may be rarely visited by a policy, it may be <em>unreasonable</em> to treat all the states as equally important.</u></p>
<p>(2) The second way is to use the <strong>stationary distribution</strong>：(setting the probability of each state to the frequency of agent access to the state.)</p>
<p>The stationary distribution describes <strong>the long-term behavior of a Markov decision process.</strong> More specifically, after the agent executes a given policy for a sufficiently long period, the probability of the agent being located at any state can be described by this stationary distribution.</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
J(w) =\mathbf{E}[(v_{\pi}(S)-\hat{v}(S,w))^2]= \sum_{s \in S}d_{\pi}(s)(v_{\pi}(s)-\hat{v}(s,w))^2</script><p>which $d_{\pi}(s)$ denote the stationary distribution of the Markov process under policy $\pi$. $\sum_{s \in S}d_{\pi}(s)=1$.</p>
<p>it was assumed that the number of states was finite in the above equation. When the state space is continuous, we can replace the summations with integrals.</p>
<p>It is notable that the value of $d_{\pi}(s)$ is nontrivial to obtain because it requires knowing the state transition probability matrix $P_{\pi}$. Fortunately, we do not need to calculate the specific value of $d_{\pi}(s)$ to minimize this objective function as shown in the next subsection. <u><strong>I.e. When optimizing based on gradient descent, the experience samples are collected by the behavior strategy, which inherently have the meaning of $d_{\pi}(s)$.</strong></u></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conditions for the uniqueness of stationary distributions.</strong><br>A general class of Markov processes that have unique stationary(or limiting)distributions is <em>irreducible</em>(or <em>regular</em>) Markov processes.<br>— A Markov process is called <em>irreducible</em> if all of its states communicate with each other.<br>— A Markov process is called <em>regular</em> if there exists $k &gt;=1$ such that $[P_{\pi}]_{ij}^k&gt;0$ for all $i,j$. States $j$ is said to be accessible from state $s_i$ if there exists a finite integer $k$ so that $[P_{\pi}]_{ij}^k&gt;0$</p>
<p> <strong>Policies that may lead to unique stationary distributions.</strong><br>Once the policy is given, a Markov decision process becomes a Markov process, whose long-term behavior is jointly determined by the given policy and the system model. Then,an important question is what kind of policies can lead to regular Markov processes? In general,the answer is <strong>exploratory policies such as $\epsilon$-greedy policies</strong>. I.e.,since all the states communicate,there sulting Markov process is irreducible. Second, since every state can transition to itself, there resulting Markov process is regular.<br>— <strong>application</strong> —<br><em>There  are two methods to calculate the stationary distributions.</em><br>— (1) The theoretical value of $d_{\pi}$ can be calculated by the state transition probability matrix $P_{\pi}$.<br>— (2) The second method is to estimated $d_{\pi}$ numerically. we start from an arbitrary initial state and generate a sufficiently long episode by following the given policy. we select $s_1$ as the starting state and run 1000 steps by following the policy. The proportion of the visits of each state during the process is shown in the below Figure(<em> represent the theoretical value of $d_{\pi}(s_i)$). <em>*It can be seen that the proportions converge to the theoretical value of $d_{\pi}$ after hundreds of steps.</em></em> It is clear clarify that the experience samples are collected by the behavior strategy, which inherently have the meaning of $d_{\pi}(s)$.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-30-22-35-21.png" alt=""></p>

& =-2\mathbb{E}[\nabla_{w}(v_{\pi}(S)-\hat{v}(S,w_k))\nabla_{w}\hat{v}(S,w_k)]
\end{aligned}</script><p>Therefore, the gradient descent algorithm is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
w_{k+1}=w_k +2\alpha_{k}\mathbb{E}[(v_{\pi}(S)-\hat{v}(S,w_k))\nabla_{w}\hat{v}(S,w_k)],
\tag{8.4}</script><p>where the coefficient 2 before $\alpha_{k}$ can be merged into $\alpha_{k}$ without loss of generality. In the spirit of stochastic gradient descent, we can replace the true gradient with a stochastic gradient. Then, becomes</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">

<p>The following two methods can replace $v_{\pi}(s_t)$ with an approximation to make the algorithm implementable.<br>—— Monte Carlo method: Suppose that we have an episode $(s_0,r_1,s_1, r_2<br>\dots )$.

The lengths of $\phi(s)$ and $w$ are equal to $m$, which is usually much smaller than the number of states. In the linear case, the gradient is $\nabla_{w}\hat{v}(s,w_k)=\phi(s)$.</p>
<p>This is the algorithm of TD learning with linear function approximation. We call it <strong>TD-Linear</strong> for short.</p>
<p> The linear case is much better understood in theory than the nonlinear case. However, <u><strong>its approximation ability is limited. It is also nontrivial to select appropriate feature vectors for complex tasks.</strong></u> By contrast, artificial neural networks can approximate values as black-box universal nonlinear approximates, which are more friendly to use.</p>
<p>The reason is to learn TD-linear that a better understanding of the linear case can help readers better grasp the idea of the function approximation method. More importantly, the linear case is still powerful in the sense that <strong>the tabular method can be viewed as a special linear case</strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tabular TD learning is a special case of TD-Linear.</strong><br>Consider the following special feature vector for any $s\in S$:</p>

&=w_t +\alpha_{t}(r_{t+1} + \gamma w_t(s_{t+1})-w_t(s_t)),
\end{aligned}</script><p>which is exactly the tabular TD algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We next present some examples for demonstrating <em>how to use the TD-Linear algorithm to estimate the state values of a given policy?</em> . In the meantime, we demonstrate <em>how to select feature vectors?</em></p>
<p>The grid world example is shown in the below Figure 8.6. The given policy takes any action at a state with a probability of 0.2(exploratory). Our goal is to estimate the state values under this policy. There are 25 state values in total. The true state values are shown in Figure 8.6(b). The true state values are visualized as a three-dimensional surface in Figure 8.6(c)<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-31-14-20-06.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We next show that we can use <strong>fewer than</strong> 25 parameters to approximate these state values. The simulation setup is as follows. Five hundred episodes are generated by the given policy. Each episode has 500 steps and starts from a randomly selected state-action pair following a uniform distribution. In addition, in each simulation trial, the parameter vector $w$ is <strong>randomly initialized</strong> such that each element is drawn from a standard normal distribution with a zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. We set $r_{forbidden} = r_{boundary} = -1, r_{target} = 1$, and $\gamma = 0.9$.</p>
<p>To implement the TD-Linear algorithm, we need to select the feature vector $\phi(s)$ first. There are different ways to do that as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>— (1) The first type of feature vector is based on polynomials</strong>. In the grid world example, a state $s$ corresponds to a 2D location. Let $x$ and $y$ denote the column and row indexes of $s$, respectively. To avoid numerical issues, we normalize x and y so that their values are within the interval of $[-1,+1]$. </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
&\phi(s)=\begin{bmatrix} a  \\ b  \\ \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^2,\\
&\hat{v}(s,w)=\phi^T(s)w=[x,y]\begin{bmatrix} w_1  \\ w_2  \\ \end{bmatrix}=w_1x+w_2y.
\end{aligned}</script><p>When $w$ is given, $\hat{v}(s,w) = w_1x+w_2y$ represents a 2D plane that passes through the origin. Since the surface of the state values may not pass through the origin, we need to introduce a bias to the 2D plane to better approximate the state values. In this case, the approximated state value is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
\hat{v}(s,w)=\phi^T(s)w=[1,x,y]\begin{bmatrix} w_1\\ w_2  \\ w_3  \\ \end{bmatrix}=w_1+w_2x+w_2y.
\end{aligned}</script><p>The estimation result when we use the feature vector in $[1,x,y]$ is shown in Figure 8.7(a). Although the estimation error converges as more episodes are used, <em>the error cannot decrease to zero due to the limited approximation ability of a 2D plane.</em><br>To enhance the approximation ability, we can increase the dimension of the feature vector.<br>a quadratic 3D surface: (in Figures 8.7(b))</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi(s)=[1,x,y,x^2,y^2,xy]^T \in \mathbb{R}^6</script><p>a cubic 3D surface: (in Figures 8.7(c))</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi(s)=[1,x,y,x^2,y^2,xy,x^3,y^3,x^2y,xy^2]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{10}</script><p><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-31-18-47-55.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As can be seen, the longer the feature vector is, the more accurately the state values can be approximated. <u>However, in all three cases, the estimation error cannot converge to zero because these linear approximates still have limited approximation abilities.</u></p>
<p><strong>— (2) The others type of feature vector such as Fourier basis and tile coding</strong>. First, the values of $x$ and $y$ of each state are normalized to the interval of $[0,1]$. The resulting feature vector is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi(s)=\begin{bmatrix} \vdots\\ cos(\pi(c_1x+c_2y))  \\ \vdots  \\ \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{(q+1)^2},</script><p>where $\pi$ denotes the circumference ratio,which is $3.1415\dots$ ,instead of a policy. $c_1$ or $c_2$ can be set as any integers in ${0,1,\dots,q}$,where $q$ is a user-specified integer. As a result, there are $(q+1)^2$ possible values for the pair $(c_1 c_2)$ to take. For example, in the case of $q=1$, the feature vector is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi(s)=\begin{bmatrix} cos(\pi(0x+0y))\\ cos(\pi(0x+1y))  \\ cos(\pi(1x+0y))  \\cos(\pi(1x+1y))\\ \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ cos(\pi y)  \\ cos(\pi x)  \\cos(\pi(x+y))\\ \end{bmatrix}\in \mathbb{R}^{4},</script><p>The estimation results obtained when we use the Fourier features with $q=1,2,3$ are shown in Figure 8.8. As can be seen, the higher the dimension of the feature vector is, the more accurately the state values can be approximated.</p>

<p>An illustrative example is shown in Figure 8.9. In this example, the task is to find a good policy that can lead the agent to the target when starting from the top-left state. <strong>Both the total reward and the length of each episode gradually converge to steady values.</strong> In this example, the linear feature vector is selected as the Fourier function of order 5. The expression of a Fourier feature vector is given in the above equation.</p>

<p>One may notice in Algorithm 8.2 and Algorithm 8.3 that, <strong>although the values are represented as functions, the policy $\pi(a|s)$ is still represented as a table</strong>. Thus, it still assumes nite numbers of states and actions. In Chapter 9, we will see that t<strong>he policies can be represented as functions</strong> so that continuous state and action spaces can be handled.</p>

<h4 id="8-4-1-Algorithm-description"><a href="#8-4-1-Algorithm-description" class="headerlink" title="8.4.1 Algorithm description"></a>8.4.1 Algorithm description</h4><p>Mathematically, deep Q-learning aims to minimize the following objective function:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
J=\mathbb{E}\left[\left(R+\gamma \max_{a \in \mathbb{A}(s^{\prime})}q_{t}(S^{\prime},a,w)-\hat{q}(S,A,w)\right)^2\right].

<p>To minimize the objective function in below equation, we can use the gradient descent algorithm to calculate the gradient of $J$ with respect to $w$. <strong>It is noted that the parameter $w$ appears not only in $\hat{q}(S,A,w)$ but also in $y = R+\gamma \max_{a \in \mathbb{A}(s^{\prime})}q_{t}(S^{\prime},a,w)$.</strong> it is nontrivial to calculate the gradient. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the value of $w$ in $y$ is fixed (for a short period of time) so that the calculation of the gradient becomes much easier. In particular, we introduce two networks: one is a <strong><em>main network</em></strong> representing $\hat{q}(s,a,w)$ and the other is a <strong><em>target network</em></strong> $\hat{q}(s,a,w_T)$. The objective function in this case become</p>

<p><strong>(2) experience replay and mini-batch train</strong><br>After we have collected some experience samples, we store them in a dataset called the <strong><em>replay buffer</em></strong>. In particular, let $(s,a,r,s^{\prime})$ be an experience sample and $\mathbf{B} =\lbrace(s,a,r,s^{\prime})\rbrace$ be the replay buffer. Every time we update the main network, we can draw a mini-batch of experience samples from the replay buffer. The draw of samples, or called experience replay, should follow a uniform distribution.<br>(Todo:每次随机选(有放回抽样），还是按照state-action来分类后分层随机抽样;还是说无所谓，收集样本时采用的行为策略只要足够的exploration，随机抽就行?)</p>
<p><strong>Why is experience replay necessary in deep Q-learning, and why must the replay follow a uniform distribution?</strong><br><u>The state-action samples may not be uniformly distributed in practice since they are generated as a sample sequence according to the behavior policy.If a batch of samples obtained based on the given behavior strategy is directly used for deep learning, the network will learn the preference knowledge(as opposed to generalization knowledge) of this specific batch of samples. Furthermore, it narrows the focus of learning to a specific direction in the entire space, making it difficult to extract generalized knowledge. It is necessary to break the correlation between the samples in the sequence to satisfy the assumption of uniform distribution.</u> To do this, we can use the experience replay and mini-batch train technique by uniformly drawing samples from the replay buffer. This is the mathematical reason why experience replay is necessary and why experience replay must follow a uniform distribution. </p>
<p><strong>A mini-batch of samples to train a network instead of using a single sample to update the main network ).</strong> This is one notable difference between deep and non-deep reinforcement learning algorithms. When training it with a single sample, each sample and its corresponding gradient will have too much variance, making it difficult to converge the network weights.And the computational efficiency of single sample training is lower than that of mini-bach.<br>In short, a benefit of random sampling is that each experience sample  may be used multiple times, which can increase the data efficiency. This is especially important when we have a limited amount of data.</p>
<p>The implementation procedure of deep Q-learning is summarized in Algorithm 8.3. This implementation is off-policy. It can also be adapted to become on-policy if needed.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-31-23-30-17.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="8-4-2-Illustrative-examples"><a href="#8-4-2-Illustrative-examples" class="headerlink" title="8.4.2 Illustrative examples"></a>8.4.2 Illustrative examples</h4><p>This example aims to learn the optimal action values for every state-action pair. Once the optimal action values are obtained, the optimal greedy policy can be obtained immediately.</p>
<p>A single episode is generated by the behavior policy shown in Figure 8.11(a). This behavior policy is exploratory in the sense that it has the same probability of taking any action at any state. The episode has only 1,000 steps as shown in Figure 8.11(b). Although there are only 1,000 steps, almost all the state action pairs are visited in this episode due to the <strong>strong exploration ability</strong> of the behavior policy. The replay buffer is a set of 1,000 experience samples. The mini-batch size is 100, meaning that we uniformly draw 100 samples from the replay buffer every time we acquire samples.</p>
<p>The main and target networks have the same structure: a neural network with one hidden layer of 100 neurons (the numbers of layers and neurons can be tuned). The neural network has three inputs and one output. The first two inputs are the normalized row and column indexes of a state. The third input is the normalized action index. Here, normalization means converting a value to the interval of $[0,1]$. The output of the network is the estimated action value. The reason why we design the inputs as the row and column of a state rather than a state index is that <strong><em>we know that a state corresponds to a two-dimensional location in the grid. The more information about the state we use when designing the network, the better the network can perform.</em></strong> Moreover, the neural network can also be designed in other ways. For example, it can have two inputs and five outputs, where the two inputs are the normalized row and column of a state and the outputs are the five estimated action values for the input state.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-31-23-34-00.png" alt=""><br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-31-23-34-20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As shown in Figure 8.11(d), the loss function, defined as the average squared TD error of each mini-batch, converges to zero, meaning that the network can fit the training samples well. As shown in Figure 8.11(e), the state value estimation error also converges to zero, indicating that the estimates of the optimal action values become sufficiently accurate. Then, the corresponding greedy policy is optimal. </p>
<p>This example demonstrates the high efficiency of deep Q-learning. In particular, a short episode of 1,000 steps is sufficient for obtaining an optimal policy here. By contrast, an episode with 100,000 steps is required by tabular Q-learning, as shown in Figure 7.4. <strong>One reason for the high efficiency is that the function approximation method has a strong generalization ability. Another reason is that the experience samples can be repeatedly used.</strong></p>
<p>We next deliberately challenge the deep Q-learning algorithm by considering a scenario with fewer experience samples. Figure 8.12 shows an example of an episode with merely 100 steps. In this example, although the network can still be well-trained in the sense that the loss function converges to zero, the state estimation error cannot converge to zero. <strong>That means the network can properly fit the given experience samples, but the experience samples are too few to accurately estimate the optimal action values.</strong><br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-31-23-37-51.png" alt=""><br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/10/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-DQN-algorithm/2024-05-31-23-38-00.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="8-5-Summary"><a href="#8-5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="8.5 Summary"></a>8.5 Summary</h3><p>This chapter continued introducing TD learning algorithms. However, it switches from the tabular method to the function approximation method. <em>The key to understanding the function approximation method is to know that it is an optimization problem.</em> The simplest objective function is the squared error between the true state values and the estimated values. There are also other objective functions such as the Bellman error and the projected Bellman error. We have shown that the TD-Linear algorithm actually minimizes the projected Bellman error. Several optimization algorithms such as Sarsa and Q-learning with value approximation have been introduced. </p>
<p>One reason why the value function approximation method is important is that it allows artificial neural networks to be integrated with reinforcement learning. For example, deep Q-learning is one of the most successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
<p>An important concept named stationary distribution is introduced in this chapter. The stationary distribution plays an important role in defining an appropriate objective function in the value function approximation method. It also plays a key role in Chapter 9 when we use functions to approximate policies. An excellent introduction to this topic can be found in <sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup> . </p>

<p>Q: What is the stationary distribution and why is it important?<br>A: The stationary distribution describes the long-term behavior of a Markov decision process. More specifically, after the agent executes a given policy for a sufficiently long period, the probability of the agent visiting a state can be described by this stationary distribution. More information can be found in Box 8.1.</p>
<p>The reason why this concept emerges in this chapter is that it is necessary for defining a valid objective function. In particular, the objective function involves the probability distribution of the states, which is usually selected as the stationary distribution. The stationary distribution is important not only for the value approximation method but also for the policy gradient method, which will be introduced in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the linear function approximation method?<br>A: Linear function approximation is the simplest case whose theoretical properties can be thoroughly analyzed. However, the approximation ability of this method is limited. It is also nontrivial to select appropriate feature vectors for complex tasks. By contrast, artificial neural networks can be used to approximate values as black-box universal nonlinear approximates, which are more friendly to use. Nevertheless, it is still meaningful to study the linear case to better grasp the idea of the function approximation method. Moreover, the linear case is powerful in the sense that the tabular method can be viewed as a special linear case (Box 8.2).</p>
<p>Q: Can tabular Q-learning use experience replay?<br>A: Although tabular Q-learning does not require experience replay, it can also use experience relay without encountering problems. That is because Q-learning has no requirements about how the samples are obtained due to its off-policy attribute. One benefit of using experience replay is that the samples can be used repeatedly and hence more efficiently</p>

<h3 id="Target-network"><a href="#Target-network" class="headerlink" title="Target network"></a>Target network</h3><p>Firstly, it is possible to build a DQN with a single Q Network and no Target Network. In that case, we do two passes through the Q Network, first to output the Predicted Q value, and then to output the Target Q value.</p>
<p>But that could create a potential problem. The Q Network’s weights get updated at each time step, which improves the prediction of the Predicted Q value. However, since the network and its weights are the same, it also changes the direction of our predicted Target Q values. They do not remain steady but can fluctuate after each update. This is like chasing a moving target.</p>
<p>By employing a second network that doesn’t get trained, we ensure that the Target Q values remain stable, at least for a short period. But those Target Q values are also predictions after all and we do want them to improve, so a compromise is made. After a pre-configured number of time-steps, the learned weights from the Q Network are copied over to the Target Network.</p>

<h2 id="1-Basic-Concepts"><a href="#1-Basic-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Concepts"></a>1. Basic Concepts</h2><h3 id="1-1-A-grid-world-example-Consistent-example"><a href="#1-1-A-grid-world-example-Consistent-example" class="headerlink" title="1.1 A grid world example (Consistent example)"></a>1.1 A grid world example (Consistent example)</h3><div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/06/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Concept-Notes/grid%20world.jpg" width="50%" alt="Figure 1.2: The grid world example is used throughout the book."></div>

<p>Consider an example as shown in Figure, where a robot moves in a grid world. The robot, called agent, can move across adjacent cells in the grid. At each time step, it can only occupy a single cell.The white cells are <em>accessible</em> for entry, and the orange cells are <em> forbidden </em>. There is a <em>target</em> cell that the robot would like to reach. We will use such grid world examples throughout  RL since they are intuitive for illustrating new concepts and algorithms.</p>
<p>How can the goodness of a policy be defined? The idea is that the agent should reach the target <strong>without entering any forbidden cells, taking unnecessary detours, or colliding with the boundary of the grid</strong>.It would be trivial to plan a path to reach the target cell if the agent knew the map of the grid world.<em>The task becomes nontrivial if the agent does not know any information about the environment in advance.</em> Then,  <strong>the agent must interact with the environment to find a good policy by trial and error.</strong> To do that, the concepts presented in the rest of the chapter are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-State-and-action-s-n-a-m"><a href="#1-2-State-and-action-s-n-a-m" class="headerlink" title="1.2 State and action ( $ s_n, a_m $ )"></a>1.2 State and action ( $ s_n, a_m $ )</h3><p><strong><em>State</em> describes the agent’s status with respect to the environment.</strong> The set of all the states is called the state space, denoted as $\mathcal{S}=\left\{s_1,s_2, \ldots, s_n\right\}$.</p>
<p>For each state, the agent can take actions $\mathcal{A}$. Different states can have different action spaces ($\mathcal{A}(s)$ when at state $s$) . The set of all actions is called the action space, denoted as $\mathcal{A}=\left\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_m\right\}$.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/06/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Concept-Notes/state%20and%20action.jpg" width="70%" alt="Figure 1.3: Illustrations of the state and action concepts."></div>

<p>In this RL serie, we consider the most general case: $\mathcal{A}\left(s_i\right)=\mathcal{A}=\left\{a_1, \ldots, a_5\right\}$ for all $i$.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-States-and-Observations"><a href="#1-3-States-and-Observations" class="headerlink" title="1.3 States and Observations"></a>1.3 States and Observations</h3><p>You may see the terminology “observation”. It’s similar to “states”. Whatt’s the difference?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>state</strong> $s$ is a complete description of the state of the world. There is no  information about the world which is hidden from the state. </li>
<li><p>An <strong>observation</strong> $o$ is a partial description of a state, which may omit information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The environment is <strong>fully observed</strong> when the agent is able to observe the complete state of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>The environment is <strong>partially observed</strong> when the agent can only see a partial observation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reinforcement learning notation sometimes puts the symbol for state ($s$), in places where it would be technically more appropriate to write the symbol for observation($o$). </p>
<p>Specifically, this happens when talking about how the agent decides an action: we often signal in notation that the action is conditioned on the state, when in practice, <u>the action is conditioned on the observation because the agent does not have access to the state</u>.</p>
<h3 id="1-4-State-transition-p-s-n-mid-s-1-a-2-x"><a href="#1-4-State-transition-p-s-n-mid-s-1-a-2-x" class="headerlink" title="1.4 State transition ( $p(s_{n} \mid s_1, a_{2})=x$ );"></a>1.4 State transition ( $p(s_{n} \mid s_1, a_{2})=x$ );</h3><p>When taking an action, the agent may move from one state to another. Such a process is called <strong>state transition</strong>. For example, if the agent is at state $s_1$ and selects action $a_2$ , then the agent moves to state $s_2$. Such a process can be expressed as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
s_1 \stackrel{a_2}{\rightarrow} s_2</script><ul>
<li>the agent will be bounced back because it is impossible for the agent to exit the state space. Hence, we have $s_1 \stackrel{a_1}{\rightarrow} s_1$.</li>
<li>What is the next state when the agent attempts to enter a forbidden cell, for example, taking action $a_2$ at state $s_5$ ? Two different scenarios may be encountered. </li>
<li><ol>
<li>In the first scenario, although $s_6$ is forbidden, it is still accessible. In this case, the next state is $s_6$; hence, the state transition process is $s_5 \stackrel{a_2}{\longrightarrow} s_6$. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol>
<li>In the second scenario, $s_6$ is not accessible because, for example, it is surrounded by walls. In this case, the agent is bounced back to $s_5$ if it attempts to move rightward; hence, the state transition process is $s_5 \stackrel{a_2}{\rightarrow} s_5$.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Which scenario should we consider? The answer depends on the physical environment. In this series, <u>we consider the first scenario where the forbidden cells are accessible, although stepping into them may get punished</u>. This scenario is more general and interesting. Moreover, since we are considering a simulation task, <strong>we can define the state transition process however we prefer.</strong> In real-world applications, the state transition process is determined by real-world dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically, the state transition process can be described by conditional probabilities.  $p(s_{n} \mid s_1, a_{2})=x , x\in(0,1)$; </p>
<h3 id="1-5-Policy-pi-a-mid-s"><a href="#1-5-Policy-pi-a-mid-s" class="headerlink" title="1.5 Policy ($\pi(a \mid s)$)"></a>1.5 Policy ($\pi(a \mid s)$)</h3><p><strong>A policy tells the agent which actions to take at every state.</strong> Intuitively, policies can be depicted as arrows (see Figure 1.4(a)). Following a policy, the agent can generate a trajectory starting from an initial state (see Figure 1.4(b)).</p>
<p></p><div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/06/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Concept-Notes/2024-04-11-12-33-12.png" width="80%" alt="Figure 1.4: A policy represented by arrows and some trajectories obtained by starting from different initial states."></div><br>A policy can be deterministic or stochastic.<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Deterministic policy<br> A <strong>deterministic</strong> policy is usually denoted by $\mu$ :</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 a_t=\mu\left(s_t\right) .</script></li>
<li><p>Stochastic policy (conditional probabilities)<br> A <strong>stochastic</strong> policy is usually denoted by $\pi$ :</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 a_t \sim \pi\left(\cdot \mid s_t\right) .</script><p> In this case, at state $s$, the probability of choosing action $a$ is $\pi(a \mid s)$. It holds that $\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(a \mid s)=1$ for any $s \in \mathcal{S}$.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In RL, the policies are often <strong>parameterized</strong>, the parameters are commonly denoted as $\theta$ or $\phi$ and are written as a subscript on the policy symbol:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
a_t & = \mu_{\theta}(s_t) \\ 
a_t & \sim \pi_{\theta}(\cdot | s_t).
\end{aligned}</script><h3 id="1-6-Rewards-r-s-a-p-r-mid-s-a"><a href="#1-6-Rewards-r-s-a-p-r-mid-s-a" class="headerlink" title="1.6 Rewards ($r(s, a)$, $p(r \mid s,a)$)"></a>1.6 Rewards ($r(s, a)$, $p(r \mid s,a)$)</h3><p>After executing an action at a state, the agent obtains a reward, denoted as $r$, as feedback from the environment. The reward is a function of the state $s$ and action $a$. Hence, it is also denoted as $r(s, a)$.  Its value can be a positive or negative real number or zero. </p>
<p>In the grid world example, the rewards are designed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the agent attempts to exit the boundary, let $r_{\text {boundary }}=-1$.</li>
<li>If the agent attempts to enter a forbidden cell, let $r_{\text {forbidden }}=-1$.</li>
<li>If the agent reaches the target state, let $r_{\text {target }}=+1$.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the agent obtains a reward of $r_{\text {other }}=0$.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A reward can be interpreted as a human-machine interface</strong> , with which we can guide the agent to behave as we expect. For example, with the rewards designed above, we can expect that the agent tends to avoid exiting the boundary or stepping into the forbidden cells. <u>Designing appropriate rewards is an important step in reinforcement learning. This step is, <strong>however, nontrivial for complex tasks since it may require the user to understand the given problem well.</strong> Nevertheless, it may still be much easier than solving the problem with other approaches that require a professional background or a deep understanding of the given problem.</u></p>
<p>One question that beginners may ask is as follows: if given the table of rewards, can we find good policies by simply selecting the actions with the greatest rewards? The answer is no. That is because these rewards are immediate rewards that can be obtained after taking an action. To determine a good policy, we must consider the total reward obtained in the long run (see Section 1.7 for more information). <strong>An action with the greatest immediate reward may not lead to the greatest total reward.</strong> It is possible that the immediate reward is negative while the future reward is positive. Thus, which actions to take should be determined by the return (i.e., the total reward) rather than the immediate reward to avoid short-sighted decisions.</p>
<h3 id="1-7-Trajectories-and-Return"><a href="#1-7-Trajectories-and-Return" class="headerlink" title="1.7 Trajectories and Return"></a>1.7 Trajectories and Return</h3><p>A <strong>trajectory</strong> $\tau$ is a state-action-reward chain $\tau = (s_1, a_1, s_2, a_2, …)$.</p>
<p></p><div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/06/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Concept-Notes/2024-04-11-13-19-07.png" width="100%" alt="Figure 1.6: Trajectories obtained by following two policies. The trajectories are indicated by red dashed lines."></div><br>For example, given the policy shown in Figure 1.6(a), if the agent can move along a trajectory as follows:<p></p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
s_1 \underset{r=0}{\stackrel{a_2}{\longrightarrow}} s_2 \underset{r=0}{\stackrel{a_3}{\longrightarrow}} s_5 \underset{r=0}{\stackrel{a_3}{\longrightarrow}} s_8 \underset{r=1}{\stackrel{a_2}{\longrightarrow}} s_9 .</script><p>The undiscounted <strong>return</strong> of this trajectory is defined as the sum of all the rewards collected along the trajectory:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text { return }=0+0+0+1=1 .</script><p>This return is <strong>undiscounted</strong>. But in RL we usually consider <strong>discounted</strong> return with a discount rate $\gamma \in (0,1)$ especially for the trajectory of infinite length.</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text { return }= 0+ \gamma 0+ \gamma^2 0+ \gamma^3 1 = \gamma^3 .</script><p><strong>The introduction of the discount rate is useful for the following reasons.</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>it <em>removes the stop criterion</em> and <em>allows for infinitely long trajectories</em>. </li>
<li><em>the discount rate can be used to adjust the emphasis placed on near- or far-future rewards.</em> In particular, if is close to 0, then the agent places more emphasis on rewards obtained in the near future. The resulting policy would be short-sighted. If is close to 1, then the agent places more emphasis on the far future rewards. The resulting policy is far-sighted and dares to take risks of obtaining negative rewards in the near future. </li>
</ol>
<p><u>Returns are also called <em>total rewards</em> or <em>cumulative rewards</em>.</u></p>
<h3 id="1-8-Episodes"><a href="#1-8-Episodes" class="headerlink" title="1.8 Episodes"></a>1.8 Episodes</h3><p>When interacting with the environment by following a policy, the agent may <u>stop at some terminal states</u>. In this case, the resulting trajectory is <u>finite</u>, and is called an <strong>episode</strong> (or a <strong>trial</strong>, <strong>rollout</strong>).</p>
<p>However, some tasks may have no terminal states. In this case, the resulting trajectory is <u>infinite</u>.</p>
<p>Tasks with episodes are called <u>episodic tasks</u>.  some tasks have no terminal states are called <u>continuing tasks</u>.</p>
<p>In fact, we can treat episodic and continuing tasks in a unified mathematical manner by converting episodic tasks to continuing ones. We have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, if we treat the terminal state as a special state, we can specifically design its action space or state transition so that the agent stays in this state forever. Such states are called absorbing states, meaning that the agent never leaves a state once reached.</li>
<li>Second, if we treat the terminal state as a normal state, we can simply set its action space to the same as the other states, and the agent may leave the state and come back again. <u>Since a positive reward of $r=1$ can be obtained every time $s_9$ is reached, the agent will eventually learn to stay at $s_9$ forever (self-circle)</u> to collect more rewards.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this RL series, we consider the second scenario where the target state is treated as a normal state whose action space is $\mathcal{A}\left(s_9\right)=\left\{a_1, \ldots, a_5\right\}$.</p>
<h3 id="1-9-Markov-decision-processes"><a href="#1-9-Markov-decision-processes" class="headerlink" title="1.9 Markov decision processes"></a>1.9 Markov decision processes</h3><p>This section presents the basic RL concepts in a more formal way under the framework of Markov decision processes (MDPs).</p>
<p>An MDP is a general framework for describing stochastic dynamical systems. The key ingredients of an MDP are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Sets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>— State space: the set of all states, denoted as $\mathcal{S}$.</li>
<li>— Action space: a set of actions, denoted as $\mathcal{A}(s)$, associated with each state $s \in \mathcal{S}$.</li>
<li>— <strong>Reward set</strong>: a set of rewards, denoted as $\mathcal{R}(s, a)$, associated with each state-action pair $(s, a)$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>The state, action, reward at time index $t$ are denoted as $s_t, a_t, r_t$ separately.</li>
<li>The reward depends on the state $s$ and action $a$, but not the next state $s^{\prime}$. because since $s^{\prime}$ also depends on $s$ and $a$ i.e. $p(s^{\prime}\mid s,a)$ ($s,a$后下一状态可能是随机的，$s’$代表的下一状态是固定的一种情况，因此与$s’$无关只与$s,a$有关).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Model</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State transition probability</strong>: At state $s$, when taking action $a$, the probability of transitioning to state $s^{\prime}$ is $p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right)$. It holds that $\sum_{s^{\prime} \in \mathcal{S}} p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right)=1$ for any $(s, a)$.</li>
<li><strong>Reward probability</strong>: At state $s$, when taking action $a$, the probability of obtaining reward $r$ is $p(r \mid s, a)$. It holds that $\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}(s, a)} p(r \mid s, a)=1$ for any $(s, a)$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
p(r \mid s,a )=\sum_{s^{\prime} \in \mathcal{S}}p(r \mid s,a,s^{\prime} )p(s^{\prime} \mid s,a)</script><p><strong>Policy</strong>: At state $s$, the probability of choosing action $a$ is $\pi(a \mid s)$. It holds that $\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} \pi(a \mid s)=1$ for any $s \in \mathcal{S}$.</p>
<p><strong>Markov property</strong>:</p>
<p>The name Markov Decision Process refers to the fact that the system obeys the Markov property, <strong>the memoryless property of a stochastic process.</strong> </p>
<p>Mathematically, it means that</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The state is markovian:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
p(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, s_{t-1}, \cdots, s_0)=p(s_{t+1} \mid s_t)</script></li>

The model can be either stationary or nonstationary (or in other words, time-invariant or time-variant). A stationary model does not change over time; a nonstationary model may vary over time. For instance, in the grid world example, if a forbidden area may pop up or disappear sometimes, the model is nonstationary. Unless specifically stated, <u>we only consider stationary models</u>.</p>

What is the difference between an MDP and an MP? The answer is that, <u>once the policy in an MDP is fixed, the MDP degenerates into an MP.</u> In this book, the terms “Markov process” and “Markov chain” are used interchangeably when the context is clear. Moreover, this book mainly considers finite MDPs where the numbers of  states and actions are finite. </p>

The agent is a decision-maker that can <em>sense its state, maintain policies, and execute actions</em>. Everything outside of the agent is regarded as the environment.<br>In the grid world examples, the agent and environment correspond to the robot and grid world, respectively. After the agent decides to <strong>take an action</strong>, the actuator executes such a decision. Then, the state of the agent would be changed and <strong>a reward can be obtained</strong>. By using interpreters, the agent can interpret the new state and the reward. Thus, a closed loop can be formed.</p>

<h2 id="2-State-Values-Bellman-Equation-and-Action-Values"><a href="#2-State-Values-Bellman-Equation-and-Action-Values" class="headerlink" title="2. State Values, Bellman Equation and Action Values"></a>2. State Values, Bellman Equation and Action Values</h2><p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: The <strong>state value</strong> is the average reward an agent can obtain if it follows a given policy, which is used as a metric to evaluate whether a policy is good or not. <strong>Bellman equation</strong> describes the relationships between the values of all states, which is an important tool for analyzing state values. By solving the Bellman equation, we can obtain the state values. This process is called policy evaluation, which is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning. The <strong>action value</strong> is introduced to describe the value of taking one action at a state.  Action values play a more direct role than state values when we attempt to find optimal policies. </p>
<h3 id="2-1-State-Values"><a href="#2-1-State-Values" class="headerlink" title="2.1 State Values"></a>2.1 State Values</h3><p>The goal of RL is to find an excellent policy that achieves the <strong>maximal return (or rewards)</strong>. Although returns can be used to evaluate policies, it is more formal to use state values to evaluate policies(the policy or system model may be stochastic): policies that generate greater state values are better. Therefore, state values constitute a core concept in reinforcement learning. How to calculate it? This question is answered in the next section 2.2.<br>Consider a random state-action-reward trajectory for a sequence of time steps $t = 0, 1, 2 \dots$:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
S_t \xrightarrow{A_t} R_{t+1}, S_{t+1} \stackrel{A_{t+1}}{\longrightarrow} R_{t+2}, S_{t+2} \stackrel{A_{t+2}}{\longrightarrow} R_{t+3}, \ldots</script><p>The discounted return of the trajectory is defined as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
G_t & =R_{t+1}+\gamma R_{t+2}+\gamma^2 R_{t+3}+\ldots \\
& =R_{t+1}+\gamma\left(R_{t+2}+\gamma R_{t+3}+\ldots\right) \\
& =R_{t+1}+\gamma G_{t+1}
\end{aligned}</script><p>where $R_{t+1}$ is the immediate reward of arriving state $S_{t+1}$ or leaving $S_t$, $\gamma$ is the discount rate. Note that $S_t,A_t,R_{t+1} G_t$ are all random variables.</p>
<p><u>The expectation (or called expected value or mean) of $G_t$ is called the <strong>state-value function</strong> or simply <strong>state value</strong></u>:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation} 
v_\pi(s)=\mathbb{E}\left[G_t \mid S_t=s\right]
\end{equation}</script><p>Remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a function of $s$. It is a conditional expectation with the condition that the agent starts from state $s$.</li>
<li>It is based on the policy $\pi$. For a different policy, the state value may be different.</li>
<li>It represents the “value” of a state. If the state value is greater, then the policy is better because greater cumulative rewards can be obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>The relationship between state values and returns is further clarified as follows</u>. When both <strong>the policy and the system model are deterministic</strong>, starting from a state always leads to the same trajectory. In this case, the return obtained starting from a state is equal to the value of that state. By contrast, when either <strong>the policy or the system model is stochastic</strong>, starting from the same state may generate different trajectories. In this case, the returns of different trajectories are different, and the state value is the mean of these returns.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Bellman-Equation"><a href="#2-2-Bellman-Equation" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Bellman Equation"></a>2.2 Bellman Equation</h3><p>the Bellman equation is a set of linear equations that describe the relationships between the values of all the states. Given a policy, finding out the corresponding state values from the Bellman equation is called <strong>policy evaluation</strong>.

To that end, we must keep exploring all actions to determine better actions for each state.</p>
<h3 id="2-7-Summary"><a href="#2-7-Summary" class="headerlink" title="2.7 Summary"></a>2.7 Summary</h3><p>The most important concept introduced in this chapter is the state value. Mathematically, a state value is the expected return that the agent can obtain by starting from a state. The values of different states are related to each other. That is, <strong>the value of state $s$ relies on the values of some other states</strong>, which may further rely on the value of state $s$ itself. This phenomenon might be the most confusing part of this chapter for beginners. It is related to an important concept called <strong>bootstrapping, which involves calculating something from itself.</strong> Although bootstrapping may be intuitively confusing, it is clear if we examine the matrix-vector form of the Bellman equation. In particular, the Bellman equation is a set of linear equations that describe the relationships between the values of all states.</p>
<p>Since state values can be used to evaluate whether a policy is good or not, <strong>the process of solving the state values of a policy from the Bellman equation is called policy evaluation.</strong> As we will see later in this book, policy evaluation is an important step in many reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
<p>Another important concept, action value, was introduced to describe the value of taking one action at a state. As we will see later in this book, <strong>action values play a more direct role than state values when we attempt to find optimal policies.</strong> Finally, the Bellman equation is not restricted to the reinforcement learning field. Instead, it widely exists in many elds such as control theories and operation research. In different elds, the Bellman equation may have different expressions. In this book, the Bellman equation is studied under discrete Markov decision processes.</p>
<p><strong> How to calculate action value</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can first calculate all the state values and then calculate the action values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We can also directly calculate the action values with or without models (discussed later).</p>

v_{\pi_1}(s) \geq v_{\pi_2}(s) \quad \text { for all } s \in \mathcal{S}</script><p>then $\pi_1$ is said to be <strong>better</strong> than $\pi_2$.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>(Optimal policy and optimal state value). A policy $\pi^\ast$<br>is optimal if $v_{\pi^\ast}(s) \geq v_\pi(s)$ for all $s\in S$ and for any other policy $\pi$. The state values $\pi^\ast$ of are the optimal state values.</p>
<p>The definition leads to many questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the optimal policy <strong>exist</strong>?</li>
<li>Is the optimal policy <strong>unique</strong>?</li>
<li>Is the optimal policy <strong>stochastic or deterministic</strong>?</li>
<li><strong>How to obtain</strong> the optimal policy?</li>
</ul>
<p>These fundamental questions must be clearly answered to thoroughly understand optimal policies. For example, regarding the existence of optimal policies, if optimal policies do not exist, then we do not need to bother to design algorithms to find them. To answer these questions, we study the <em>Bellman optimality equation</em>.</p>

But since each row in the matrix is actually a vector of the elementwise form, we start with the element form.</p>
<p>In fact, we can turn the problem into “solve the optimal $\pi$ on the right-hand side, next to get the optimal state values “. Let’s look at one example first:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Example</strong> 1. Consider two unknown variables $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ that satisfy</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
x=\max _{y \in \mathbb{R}}\left(2 x-1-y^2\right) .</script><p>The first step is to solve $y$ on the right-hand side of the equation. Regardless of the value of $x$, we always have $\max _y\left(2 x-1-y^2\right)=2 x-1$, where the maximum is achieved when $y=0$. The second step is to solve $x$. When $y=0$, the equation becomes $x=2 x-1$, which leads to $x=1$. Therefore, $y=0$ and $x=1$ are the solutions of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> 2. Given $q_1, q_2, q_3 \in \mathbb{R}$, we would like to find the optimal values of $c_1, c_2, c_3$ to maximize</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sum_{i=1}^3 c_i q_i=c_1 q_1+c_2 q_2+c_3 q_3,</script><p>where $c_1+c_2+c_3=1$ and $c_1, c_2, c_3 \geq 0$.<br>Without loss of generality, suppose that $q_3 \geq q_1, q_2$. Then, the optimal solution is $c_3^\ast=1$ and $c_1^\ast=c_2^\ast=0$. This is because</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
q_3=\left(c_1+c_2+c_3\right) q_3=c_1 q_3+c_2 q_3+c_3 q_3 \geq c_1 q_1+c_2 q_2+c_3 q_3</script><p>for any $c_1, c_2, c_3$.</p>
<hr>
<p>Inspired by the above example, since $\sum_a(\pi(a \mid s))= 1$, the (elementwise) BOE can be written as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
v(s)=\max _{\pi(s) \in \Pi(s)} \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi(a \mid s) q(s, a)\quad =\max _{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} q(s, a) , s \in \mathcal{S}.</script><p>where the optimality is achieved when</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi(a \mid s)= \begin{cases}1 & a=a^* \\ 0 & a \neq a^*\end{cases}</script><p>where $a^*=\arg \max _a q(s, a)$(arg is get the variant value).</p>
<p><strong>In summary, the optimal policy $\pi(s)$ is the one that selects the action that has the greatest value of $q(s,a)$.</strong></p>
<p>Now that we know the solution of BOE is to maximize the right-hand side, - just select the greatest action value $q(s,a)$. But <strong>we don’t know action value or state value at this time</strong>, next , we need study how to obtain state value from the <em>contraction mapping theorem</em>  on the matrix-vector form. </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\left[r_\pi\right]_s \doteq \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi(a \mid s) \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} p(r \mid s, a) r, \quad\left[P_\pi\right]_{s, s^{\prime}}=p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s\right) \doteq \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi(a \mid s) p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right) .</script><p>Since the optimal value of $\pi$ is determined by $v$, the right-hand side of BOE (matrix-vector form) is a function of $v$, denoted as</p>

<p> Concepts: Fixed point and Contraction mapping</p>

<p><strong>Example1</strong><br>Given $x=f(x)=A x$, where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n, A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $|A| \leq \gamma&lt;1$.<br>It is easy to verify that $x=0$ is a fixed point since $0=A 0$. To see the contraction property,</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\left\|A x_1-A x_2\right\|=\left\|A\left(x_1-x_2\right)\right\| \leq\|A\|\left\|x_1-x_2\right\| \leq \gamma\left\|x_1-x_2\right\| .</script><p>Therefore, $f(x)=A x$ is a contraction mapping.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem: Contraction Mapping Theorem</strong><br>For any equation that has the form of $x=f(x)$,where $x$ and $f(x)$ are real vectors if $f$ is a contraction mapping, then the following peoperties hold.</p>

If every reward $r \in \mathcal{R}$ is changed by an affine transformation to $\alpha r+\beta$, where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha&gt;0$, then the corresponding optimal state value $v^{\prime}$ is also an affine transformation of $v^\ast$ :</p>

<p>Q: What is the definition of optimal policies?<br>A: A policy is optimal if its corresponding state values are greater than or equal to any other policy. It should be noted that this specific definition of optimality is valid only for tabular reinforcement learning algorithms. <strong>When the values or policies are approximated by functions, different metrics must be used to define optimal policies.</strong> This will become clearer in Chapters 8 and 9.</p>
<p>Q: Are optimal policies stochastic or deterministic?<br>A: An optimal policy can be either deterministic or stochastic. A nice fact is that there always exist deterministic greedy optimal policies.</p>
<p>Q: If we increase all the rewards by the same amount, will the optimal state value change? Will the optimal policy change?<br>A: Increasing all the rewards by the same amount is an affine transformation of the rewards, which would not affect the optimal policies. However, the optimal state value would increase, as shown in (Optimal policy invariance).</p>

In this chapter, we show that <strong><em><u>policies can be represented by parameterized functions denoted as $\pi(a|s,\theta)$</u></em></strong>, where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a parameter vector.

The advantages of the policy gradient method are numerous. For example, it is <strong>more efficient for handling large state/action spaces.</strong> It has <strong>stronger generalization abilities</strong> and hence is more efficient in terms of sample usage.</p>

<p>The basic idea of the policy gradient method is summarized below. Suppose that <strong>$J(\theta)$ is a scalar metric.</strong> Optimal policies can be obtained by optimizing this metric via the gradient-based algorithm:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation}
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t}+\alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta_t),
\end{equation}</script><p>where $\nabla_\theta J$ is the gradient of $J$ with respect to $\theta$ , $t$ is the time step, and $\alpha$ is the optimization rate.<br>With this basic idea, we will answer the following three questions in the remainder of this chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>What <strong>metrics</strong> should be used? (Section 9.2).</li>
<li>How to <strong>calculate the gradients</strong> of the metrics? (Section 9.3)</li>
<li>How to <strong>use experience samples</strong> to calculate the gradients? (Section 9.4)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="9-2-Metrics-for-defining-optimal-policies"><a href="#9-2-Metrics-for-defining-optimal-policies" class="headerlink" title="9.2 Metrics for defining optimal policies"></a>9.2 Metrics for defining optimal policies</h3><p>If a policy is represented by a function, there are two types of metrics for defining optimal policies. One is based on state values and the other is based on immediate rewards.</p>
<p><strong>Metric 1: Average state value(Average value)</strong></p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation}
\bar{v}_\pi = \sum_{s \in S}d(s)v_{\pi}(s)=\mathbb{E}_{S \sim d}[v_\pi(S)],
\end{equation}</script><p>where $d(s)$ is the weight of state $s$ (probability distribution).It satisfies $d(s)\geq0$ for any $s \in S$ and $\sum_{s \in S}d(s) = 1$.<br>How to select the distribution $d$ ? There are two cases.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first and simplest case is that $d$ is <strong>independent</strong> of the policy $\pi$. In this case, we specifically denote $d$ as $d_0$ and $\bar{v}_{\pi}$ as $\bar{v}_{\pi}^0$ to indicate that the distribution is independent of the policy.<br>——- One case is to treat all the states equally important and select $d_0(s) = 1/|S|$. (<strong>random</strong>)<br>——- Another case is when we are <strong>only</strong> interested in a specific state $s_0$  (e.g., the agent always starts from $s_0$). In this case, we can design $d_0(s_0)=1, d_0(s \neq s_0)=0 $.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second case is that $d$ is <strong>dependent</strong> on the policy $\pi$.In this case, it is common to select $d$ as $d_{\pi}$ , which is the <strong>stationary distribution</strong> under $\pi$.<br>The interpretation of selecting $d_{\pi}$ is as follows. The stationary distribution reflects the long-term behavior of a Markov decision process under a given policy. If one state is frequently visited in the long term, it is more important and deserves a higher weight; if a state is rarely visited, then its importance is low and deserves a lower weight.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose that an agent collects rewards $\{R_{t+1}\}_{t=0}^\infty$ by following a given policy $\pi(\theta)$. Readers may often see the following metric in the literature(red and blue):</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
J(\theta) &= \textcolor{red}{\lim_{n \to \infty}\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^n \gamma^t R_{t+1}\right ]} = \textcolor{blue}{\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R_{t+1}\right]},\\
&= \sum_{s \in S}d(s)\mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R_{t+1}|S_0 =s \right]\\
& = \sum_{s \in S}d(s)v_{\pi}(s)\\
& = \textcolor{green}{\bar{v}_{\pi}}
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}</script><p><strong>Metric 2: Average reward (Average one-step reward)</strong></p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
\bar{r}_\pi = \sum_{s \in S}d_{\pi}(s)r_{\pi}(s)&=\mathbb{E}_{S \sim d_{\pi}}[r_\pi(S)],\\
&= \mathbb{E}_{S \sim d_{\pi}}\left[\sum_{a \in A}\pi(a|s,\theta)r(s,a)\right]\\
&= \mathbb{E}_{S \sim d_{\pi},A \sim \pi(s,\theta)}\left[r(s,A)|s\right]\\
\end{aligned}
\tag{4}</script><p>where $d_{\pi}$ is the stationary distribution, $r_{\pi}(s)$ is the expectation of the immediate rewards.</p>
<p>Suppose that an agent collects rewards $\{R_{t+1}\}_{t=0}^\infty$ by following a given policy $\pi(\theta)$. A common metric that readers may often see in the literature is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
J(\theta) = \textcolor{red}{\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{n}\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} R_{t+1}\right ]} &= \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{s \in S}d(s) \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} R_{t+1}|S_0=s \right ]\\
&= \sum_{s \in S}d(s)\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=0}^{n-1}\mathbb{E}\left[ R_{t+1}\right |S_0=s_0 ]\\
&= \sum_{s \in S}d(s)\lim_{n \to \infty}\mathbb{E}\left[ R_{t+1}\right |S_0=s_0 ]\\

&= \sum_{s \in S}d_{\pi}(s)\bar{r}_{\pi}\\
& = \textcolor{green}{\bar{r}_{\pi}}
\end{aligned}
\tag{5}</script><p>Up to now, we have introduced two types of metrics: $\bar{v}_{\pi}$ and $\bar{r}_{\pi}$ . Each metric has several different but equivalent expressions. They are summarized in Table 9.2.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/11/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-REINFORCE-and-AC-algorithms/2024-06-05-22-13-35.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All these metrics are functions of $\pi$. Since $\pi$ is parameterized by $\theta$, these metrics are functions of $\theta$. In other words, <strong>different values of $\theta$ can generate different metric values.</strong> Therefore, we can search for the optimal values of $\theta$ to maximize these metrics. This is the basic idea of policy gradient methods.<br>The two metrics $\bar{v}_{\pi}$ and $\bar{r}_{\pi}$ are equivalent in the discounted case where $\gamma&lt; 1$. In particular, it can be shown that</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation}\tag{6}
\bar{r}_\pi = (1-\gamma)\bar{v}_\pi
\end{equation}</script><blockquote>
<p>Note that $\bar{v}_{\pi}(\theta) = d_{\pi}^Tv_{\pi}$ and $\bar{r}_{\pi}(\theta) = d_{\pi}^Tr_{\pi}$ , where $v_{\pi}$ and $r_{\pi}$ satisfy the Bellman equation $v_{\pi} = r_{\pi} + \gamma P_{\pi}v_{\pi}$ . Multiplying $d_{\pi}^T$ on both sides of the Bellman equation yields</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\bar{v}_\pi = \bar{r}_\pi + \gamma d_{\pi}^TP_{\pi}v_{\pi}=\bar{r}_\pi + \gamma d_{\pi}^Tv_{\pi}=\bar{r}_\pi +\gamma \bar{v}_\pi \text{     (QED)}</script></blockquote>
<p><strong>The above equation indicates that these two metrics can be simultaneously maximized.</strong></p>

The gradient of $J(\theta )$ is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">

\tag{7}</script><p>where is $\eta$ a state distribution and $\nabla_{\theta}\pi$ is the gradient of $\pi$ with respect to $\theta$.  $\ln$ is the natural logarithm. <strong>A natural logarithm function is introduced to express the gradient as an expected value $ \nabla_{\theta}\ln A(\theta)=\frac{\nabla_{\theta}A(\theta)}{A(\theta)} $. In this way, we can approximate the true gradient with a stochastic one.</strong> It is notable that $\pi(a|s,\theta)$must be positive for all $(s,a)$ to ensure that $\ln\pi(a|s,\theta)$ is valid.This can be achieved by using <em>softmax functions(Relu functions)</em>:</p>

<p>Theorem 9.1 is a summary of the results in Theorem 9.2, 9.3,and 9.5. These three theorems address different scenarios involving different metrics and discounted/undiscounted cases, but the gradients in these scenarios all have similar expressions. In particular, $J(\theta)$ could be $\bar{v}_{\pi}^0$, $\bar{v}_{\pi}$, or $\bar{r}_{\pi}$. The equality in Theorem 9.1 may become a strict equality or an approximation.

</li>
<li><p>The algorithm can strike a balance between exploration and exploitation.<br>$\beta_t$ is proportional to $q_t(s_t,a_t)$.

Therefore, the algorithm attempts to <strong>exploit actions with greater values</strong>.<br>$\beta_t$ is inversely proportional to $\pi(a_t|s_t,\theta_t)$ when $q_t(s_t,a_t)&gt;0$. As a result, if the probability of selecting $a_t$ is small, then $\beta_t$ is enhanced so that $\theta_{t+1}$ make the probability of selecting $a_t$ increases ($\pi(a_t|s_t,\theta_t)$). Therefore, the algorithm attempts to <strong>explore actions with low probabilities.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, since (12) uses samples to approximate the true gradient, it is important to understand how the samples should be obtained.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How to sample $S$? $S$ in the true gradient $\mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \ln\pi(A|S, \theta_t)q_{\pi}(S,A)]$ should obey the distribution $\eta$ which is either the stationary distribution $d_{\pi}$ or the discounted total probability distribution $\rho_{\pi}$ in (9). Either $d_{\pi}$ or $\rho_{\pi}$ represents the long-term behavior exhibited under $\pi$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How to sample $A$? $A$ in $\mathbb{E}[\nabla_\theta \ln\pi(A|S, \theta_t)q_{\pi}(S,A)]$ should obey the distribution of $\pi(A|S,\theta)$. The ideal way to sample $A$ is to select at following $\pi(a|s_t, \theta_t)$. Therefore,<strong> the policy gradient algorithm is on-policy.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, the ideal ways for sampling $S$ and $A$ are not strictly followed in practice due to their low efficiency of sample usage.A more sample-efficient implementation of (12) is given in Algorithm 9.1. In this implementation, an episode is first generated by following $\pi(\theta)$.

That is to select an appropriate scalar metric and then optimize it via a gradient-ascent algorithm.<br>The most complicated part of the policy gradient method is the derivation of the gradients of the metrics. That is because we have to distinguish various scenarios with different metrics and discounted/undiscounted cases. Fortunately, the expressions of the gradients in different scenarios are similar.Hence, we summarized the expressions in Theorem 9.1, which is the most important theoretical result in this chapter.<br>The policy gradient algorithm in (12) must be properly understood since it is the foundation of many advanced policy gradient algorithms. In the next chapter, this algorithm will be extended to another important policy gradient method called actor-critic.</p>
<h2 id="10-Actor-Critic-Methods"><a href="#10-Actor-Critic-Methods" class="headerlink" title="10 Actor-Critic Methods"></a>10 Actor-Critic Methods</h2><p>“actor-critic” refers to a structure that incorporates both policy-based and value-based methods. An <strong><em>actor</em></strong> refers to a policy update step. The reason that it is called an actor is that the actions are taken by following the policy. Here, an <strong><em>critic</em></strong> refers to a value update step. It is called a critic because it criticizes the actor by evaluating its corresponding values. In addition, actor-critic methods are still policy gradient algorithms.</p>

In addition, it is notable that the policy $\pi(\theta_t)$ is stochastic and hence exploratory. Therefore, it can be directly used to generate experience samples without relying on techniques such as $\epsilon$-greedy.

Special attention must be paid to why the critic is off-policy but does not require the importance sampling technique. In particular, the experience sample required by the critic is $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}, \textcolor{red}{\tilde{a}_{t+1}})$, where $\tilde{a}_{t+1} = µ(s_{t+1})$.

The first policy that generates $a_t$ is the behavior policy since $a_t$ is used to interact with the environment. The second policy must be $µ$ because it is the policy that the critic aims to evaluate. Hence, $µ$ is the target policy. It should be noted that $\tilde{a}_{t+1}$ is not used to interact with the environment in the next time step. Hence, $µ$ is not the behavior policy. Therefore, the critic is off-policy.</p>

<p>DPG算法优点：</p>
<ul>
<li>能够处理具有无限元素的动作集合，提高算法的泛化性与训练效率</li>
<li><p>由于无需直接对动作进行采样，因此是off-policy算法，同时能够避免重要性因子过大导致的梯度爆炸（不恰当的采样策略会导致其与目标策略之间的分布间差异过大）</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
E(\nabla_{\theta}\mu(S)(\nabla_a q_S,a=\mu(S)))</script><p>可以观察到<strong>真实梯度中并不包含对动作值的采样</strong>（取而代之的是由Actor Net直接输出的动作值估计），因此是off-policy算法</p>

<li>On-policy和Off-policy分别适用于解决什么类型的任务？为什么？<br><em>答：On-policy适合解决给定起始状态和终点状态之间最优‘路径’一类问题，Off-policy适合求解任意状态的最优策略。这是由于On-policy算法的behavior policy和target policy是同一个，因此无法保证充分地探索每一个‘状态-动作’对；而Off-policy算法的前述两类policy并非同一个，因此可以选择随机性较强的behavior policy（例如均匀随机策略）来充分探索。</em></li>
<li>Online和Offline算法分别适用于解决什么类型的任务？为什么？<em>答：Online算法适合样本量较少情况下的学习任务，诸多算法都利用了Generalized Policy Iteration的思想，效率较高；Offline算法适合已经拥有大量样本的情况，因为利用模拟仿真的方法（例如，Monte-Carlo）采样效率较低。</em></li>

<h3 id="10-5-Summary"><a href="#10-5-Summary" class="headerlink" title="10.5 Summary"></a>10.5 Summary</h3><p>In this chapter, we introduced actor-critic methods. The contents are summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Section 10.1 introduced the simplest actor-critic algorithm called QAC. This algorithm is similar to the policy gradient algorithm, REINFORCE, introduced in the last chapter. The only difference is that the q-value estimation in QAC relies on TD learning while REINFORCE relies on Monte Carlo estimation.</p>
<p>Section 10.2 extended QAC to advantage actor-critic. It was shown that the policy gradient is invariant to any additional baseline. It was then shown that an optimal baseline could help reduce the estimation variance.</p>
<p>Section 10.3 further extended the advantage actor-critic algorithm to the off-policy case. To do that, we introduced an important technique called importance sampling.</p>
<p>Finally, while all the previously presented policy gradient algorithms rely on stochastic policies, we showed in Section 10.4 that the policy can be forced to be deterministic. The corresponding gradient was derived, and the deterministic policy gradient algorithm was introduced.</p>
<p>Policy gradient and actor-critic methods are widely used in modern reinforcement learning. There exist a large number of advanced algorithms in the literature such as SAC <sup><a href="#fn_7" id="reffn_7">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_8" id="reffn_8">8</a></sup>, TRPO <sup><a href="#fn_9" id="reffn_9">9</a></sup>, PPO <sup><a href="#fn_10" id="reffn_10">10</a></sup>, and TD3 <sup><a href="#fn_11" id="reffn_11">11</a></sup>. In addition, the single-agent case can also be extended to the case of multi-agent reinforcement learning <sup><a href="#fn_12" id="reffn_12">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_13" id="reffn_13">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_14" id="reffn_14">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_15" id="reffn_15">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_16" id="reffn_16">16</a></sup>. Experience samples can also be used to fit system models to achieve model-based reinforcement learning <sup><a href="#fn_17" id="reffn_17">17</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_18" id="reffn_18">18</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_19" id="reffn_19">19</a></sup>. Distributional reinforcement learning provides a fundamentally different perspective from the conventional one <sup><a href="#fn_20" id="reffn_20">20</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_21" id="reffn_21">21</a></sup>. The relationships between reinforcement learning and control theory have been discussed in <sup><a href="#fn_22" id="reffn_22">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_23" id="reffn_23">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_24" id="reffn_24">24</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_25" id="reffn_25">25</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_26" id="reffn_26">26</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn_27" id="reffn_27">27</a></sup>. This book is not able to cover all these topics. Hopefully, the foundations laid by this book can help readers better study them in the future.</p>

<p>The value iteration algorithm is <strong>exactly</strong> the algorithm suggested by the contraction mapping theorem for solving the Bellman optimality equation (BOE).</p>
<p>The BOE Solution algorithm is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation} 
v_{k+1}=\max _{\pi \in \Pi}\left(r_\pi+\gamma P_\pi v_k\right), \quad k=0,1,2, \ldots
\end{equation}</script><p>It is guaranteed  that $v_k$ and $\pi_k$ converge to the optimal state value and an optimal policy as $k \rightarrow \infty$, respectively.</p>
<p>value iteration is an iterative algorithm. Each iteration has two steps.<br><strong>Step 1</strong>: policy update($v_k$ → $\pi_{k+1}$). This step is to solve</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation} 
\pi_{k+1}=\arg \max _\pi\left(r_\pi+\gamma P_\pi v_k\right)
\end{equation}</script><p>where $v_k$ is obtained in the previous iteration.$v_0$ can be random setting.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: value update($v_k$,$\pi_{k+1}$ → $v_{k+1}$). </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation} 
v_{k+1}=r_{\pi_{k+1}}+\gamma P_{\pi_{k+1}} v_k,
\end{equation}</script><p>where $v_{k+1}$ will be used in the next iteration.</p>
<p>The value iteration algorithm introduced above is in a matrix-vector form. It’s useful for understanding the core idea of the algorithm. To implement this algorithm, we need to further examine its elementwise form.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Policy update(elementwise form)</p>
<p>The elementwise form of $\pi_{k+1}$ is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_{k+1}(s)=\arg \max _\pi \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) \underbrace{\left(\sum_r p(r \mid s, a) r+\gamma \sum_{s^{\prime}} p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right) v_k\left(s^{\prime}\right)\right)}_{q_k(s, a)}, \quad s \in \mathcal{S}</script><p>The optimal policy solving the above optimization problem is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_{k+1}(a \mid s)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
1 & a=a_k^*(s) \\
0 & a \neq a_k^*(s)
\end{array}\right.</script><p>where $a_k^<em>(s)=\arg \max _a q_k(a, s).<br>\pi_{k+1}$ is called a <em>*greedy</em></em> policy, since it simply selects the greatest q-value.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Value update(elementwise form)</p>
<p>The elementwise form of $v_{k+1}$ is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
v_{k+1}(s)=\sum_a \pi_{k+1}(a \mid s) \underbrace{\left(\sum_r p(r \mid s, a) r+\gamma \sum_{s^{\prime}} p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right) v_k\left(s^{\prime}\right)\right)}_{q_k(s, a)}, \quad s \in \mathcal{S}</script><p>Since $\pi_{k+1}$ is greedy, the above equation is simply</p>

<p>Note: Although $v_k$ eventually converges to the optimal state value , it is <strong>not</strong> a state value, it doesn’t ensure to satisfy the Bellman equation($ v_k=r_{\pi_{k+1}}+\gamma P_{\pi_{k+1}} v_k$ or $v_k=r_{\pi_{k}}+\gamma P_{\pi_{k}} v_k$). It is merely an intermediate value generated by the algorithm. In addition, since $v_k$ is not a state value,$q_k$ is not an action value. <strong> $v_k$ can be seen as State value that has not yet converged, which be calculated only once</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="4-2-Policy-iteration"><a href="#4-2-Policy-iteration" class="headerlink" title="4.2 Policy iteration"></a>4.2 Policy iteration</h3><p>Policy iteration is an iterative algorithm. Each iteration has two steps.</p>
<p>Given a random initial policy $\pi_0$, in each policy iteration we do</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>policy evaluation (PE)</strong><br>That is to solve the following Bellman equation:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation} 
v_{\pi_k}=r_{\pi_k}+\gamma P_{\pi_k} v_{\pi_k}
\end{equation}</script><p><strong>$v_{\pi_k}$ is a state value function</strong>. So we need to get the state values for <strong>all states</strong>, not for one specific state, in PE.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>policy improvement (PI)</strong>:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_{k+1}=\arg \max _\pi\left(r_\pi+\gamma P_\pi v_{\pi_k}\right)</script><p>The <em>maximization</em> is componentwise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The policy iteration algorithm leads to a sequence</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_0 \stackrel{P E}{\longrightarrow} v_{\pi_0} \stackrel{P I}{\longrightarrow} \pi_1 \stackrel{P E}{\longrightarrow} v_{\pi_1} \stackrel{P I}{\longrightarrow} \pi_2 \stackrel{P E}{\longrightarrow} v_{\pi_2} \stackrel{P I}{\longrightarrow} \ldots \nonumber</script><p>Interestingly, policy iteration is an iterative algorithm with another iterative algorithm  embedded in the policy evaluation step. </p>
<p>In theory, this embedded iterative algorithm requires an infinite number of steps (that is, $j \rightarrow \infty$ ) to converge to the true state value $v_{\pi_k}$. This is, however, <strong>impossible to realize</strong>. In practice, the iterative process terminates when a certain criterion is satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Convergence of policy iteration). The state value sequence $\left\{v_{\pi_k}\right\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ generated by the policy iteration algorithm <strong>converges</strong> to the optimal state value $v^*$. As a result, the policy sequence $\left\{\pi_k\right\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ converges to an optimal policy.</p>
<p><strong>Elementwise form and implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Policy evaluation(elementwise form)<br>The elementwise form is:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
v_{\pi_k}^{(j+1)}(s)=\sum_a \pi_k(a \mid s)\left(\sum_r p(r \mid s, a) r+\gamma \sum_{s^{\prime}} p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right) v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}\left(s^{\prime}\right)\right), \quad s \in \mathcal{S}, \nonumber</script><p>Stop when $j \rightarrow \infty$ or $j$ is sufficiently large or $\left|v_{\pi_k}^{(j+1)}-v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}\right|$ is sufficiently small.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Policy improvement(elementwise form)<br>Recalling the solution to do policy improvement with matrix-vector form: $\pi_{k+1}=\arg \max _\pi\left(r_\pi+\gamma P_\pi v_{\pi_k}\right)$</p>
<p>The elementwise form is:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_{k+1}(s)=\arg \max _\pi \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) \underbrace{\left(\sum_r p(r \mid s, a) r+\gamma \sum_{s^{\prime}} p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right) v_{\pi_k}\left(s^{\prime}\right)\right)}_{q_{\pi_k}(s, a)}, \quad s \in \mathcal{S} . \nonumber</script><p>Here, $q_{\pi_k}(s, a)$ is the action value under policy $\pi_k$. Let</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
a_k^*(s)=\arg \max _a q_{\pi_k}(a, s) \nonumber</script><p>Then, the greedy policy is</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_{k+1}(a \mid s)= \begin{cases}1 & a=a_k^*(s), \\ 0 & a \neq a_k^*(s) .\end{cases} \nonumber</script><p><u><strong>Procedure summary:</strong></u><br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/08/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-model-based-non-incremental/2024-04-19-15-30-58.png" alt="Algorithm 4.2: Policy iteration algorithm."></p>
<h3 id="4-3-Truncated-policy-iteration"><a href="#4-3-Truncated-policy-iteration" class="headerlink" title="4.3 Truncated policy iteration"></a>4.3 Truncated policy iteration</h3><p>We will see that the value iteration and policy iteration algorithms are two special cases of the truncated policy iteration algorithm.</p>
<p>The above steps of the two algorithms can be illustrated as</p>
<p>Policy iteration: $\pi_0 \xrightarrow{P E} v_{\pi_0} \xrightarrow{P I} \pi_1 \xrightarrow{P E} v_{\pi_1} \xrightarrow{P I} \pi_2 \xrightarrow{P E} v_{\pi_2} \xrightarrow{P I} \ldots$.</p>
<p>Value iteration: $\quad \quad  \quad  v_0 \xrightarrow{P U} \pi_1^{\prime} \xrightarrow{V U} v_1 \xrightarrow{P U} \pi_2^{\prime} \xrightarrow{V U} v_2 \xrightarrow{P U} \ldots$</p>
<p>It can be seen that the procedures of the two algorithms are very similar.<br>We examine their value steps more closely to see the difference between the two algorithms. In particular, let both algorithms start from the same initial condition: $v_0=v_{\pi_0}$. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/08/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-model-based-non-incremental/2024-04-19-15-35-44.png" alt="Table 4.6: A comparison between the implementation steps of policy iteration and value iteration."></p>
<p>The procedures of the two algorithms are listed in Table 4.6. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the first three steps, the two algorithms generate the same results since $v_0=v_{\pi_0}$. <strong>They become different in the fourth step</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>During the fourth step, the value iteration algorithm executes $v_1=r_{\pi_1}+\gamma P_{\pi_1} v_0$, which is a <u> one-step calculation </u> , whereas the policy iteration algorithm solves $v_{\pi_1}=r_{\pi_1}+\gamma P_{\pi_1} v_{\pi_1}$, which requires <u> an infinite number of iterations</u>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we explicitly write out the iterative process for solving $v_{\pi_1}=r_{\pi_1}+\gamma P_{\pi_1} v_{\pi_1}$ in the fourth step, everything becomes clear. By letting $v_{\pi_1}^{(0)}=v_0$, we have</p>
<p><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/08/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-model-based-non-incremental/2024-04-19-15-38-37.png" alt="Comparisons"></p>
<p>The following observations can be obtained from the above process.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the iteration is run <em>only once</em>, then $v_{\pi_1}^{(1)}$ is actually $v_1$, as calculated in the value iteration algorithm.</li>
<li>iteration is run <em>an infinite number of times</em>, then $v_{\pi_1}^{(\infty)}$ is actually $v_{\pi_1}$, as calculated in the policy iteration algorithm.</li>
<li>If the iteration is run <em>a finite number of times (denoted as $j_{\text {truncate }}$ )</em>, then such an algorithm is called <strong>truncated policy iteration</strong>. It is called truncated because the remaining iterations from $j_{\text {truncate }}$ to $\infty$ are truncated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As a result, the value iteration and policy iteration algorithms can be viewed as two extreme cases of the truncated policy iteration algorithm: value iteration terminates at $j_{\text {truncate }}=1$, and policy iteration terminates at $j_{\text {truncate }}=\infty$.</strong> </p>
<p>It should be noted that, although the above comparison is illustrative, it is based on the condition that $v_{\pi_1}^{(0)}=v_0=v_{\pi_0}$. The two algorithms cannot be directly compared without this condition.</p>
<p><strong>Truncated policy iteration algorithm</strong></p>
<p>In a nutshell, the truncated policy iteration algorithm is <strong>the same as the policy iteration algorithm except that it merely runs a finite number of iterations in the policy evaluation step.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Lemma: Value Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Consider the iterative algorithm for solving the policy evaluation step:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
v_{\pi_k}^{(j+1)}=r_{\pi_k}+\gamma P_{\pi_k} v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}, \quad j=0,1,2, \ldots</script><p>If the initial guess is selected as $v_{\pi_k}^{(0)}=v_{\pi_{k-1}}$, it holds that</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
v_{\pi_k}^{(j+1)} \geq v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}</script><p>for every $j=0,1,2, \ldots$.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>:<br>First, since $v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}=r_{\pi_k}+\gamma P_{\pi_k} v_{\pi_k}^{(j-1)}$ and $v_{\pi_k}^{(j+1)}=r_{\pi_k}+\gamma P_{\pi_k} v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}$, we have</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
v_{\pi_k}^{(j+1)}-v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}=\gamma P_{\pi_k}\left(v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}-v_{\pi_k}^{(j-1)}\right)=\cdots=\gamma^j P_{\pi_k}^j\left(v_{\pi_k}^{(1)}-v_{\pi_k}^{(0)}\right)</script><p>Second, since $v_{\pi_k}^{(0)}=v_{\pi_{k-1}}$, we have</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
v_{\pi_k}^{(1)}=r_{\pi_k}+\gamma P_{\pi_k} v_{\pi_k}^{(0)}=r_{\pi_k}+\gamma P_{\pi_k} v_{\pi_{k-1}} \geq r_{\pi_{k-1}}+\gamma P_{\pi_{k-1}} v_{\pi_{k-1}}=v_{\pi_{k-1}}=v_{\pi_k}^{(0)},</script><p>where the inequality is due to $\pi_k=\arg \max _\pi\left(r_\pi+\gamma P_\pi v_{\pi_{k-1}}\right)$. Substituting $v_{\pi_k}^{(1)} \geq v_{\pi_k}^{(0)}$ into (4.5) yields $v_{\pi_k}^{(j+1)} \geq v_{\pi_k}^{(j)}$.</p>

<h3 id="4-4-Summary"><a href="#4-4-Summary" class="headerlink" title="4.4 Summary"></a>4.4 Summary</h3><ul>
<li><p>1 <strong>Value iteration</strong>: The value iteration algorithm is the same as the algorithm suggested by the contraction mapping theorem for solving the Bellman optimality equation. It can be decomposed into two steps: <strong>policy update and value update.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>2 <strong>Policy iteration</strong>: The policy iteration algorithm is slightly more complicated than the value iteration algorithm. It also contains two steps: <strong>policy evaluation and policy improvement</strong>.In the policy evaluation step , an iterative algorithm is required to solve the Bellman equation of the current policy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>3 <strong>Truncated policy iteration</strong>: The value iteration and policy iteration algorithms can be viewed as <strong>two extreme cases</strong> of the truncated policy iteration algorithm.  The intermediate values generated by the truncated policy iteration algorithm are not state values? Only if we run an infinite number of iterations in the policy evaluation step, can we obtain true state values. If we run a nite number of iterations, we can only obtain approximates of the true state values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A common property of the three algorithms is that every iteration has two steps. One step is to update the value, and the other step is to update the policy. <strong>The idea of interaction between value and policy updates</strong> widely exists in reinforcement learning algorithms. This idea is also called <strong>generalized policy iteration</strong>.</p>
<p>Generalized policy iteration is not a specific algorithm. Instead, it refers to the general idea of the interaction between value and policy updates. This idea is rooted in the policy iteration algorithm. Most of the reinforcement learning algorithms introduced in this book fall into the scope of generalized policy iteration.</p>
<p>Finally, the algorithms introduced in this chapter <strong>require the system model</strong>. Starting in Chapter 5, we will study model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. We will see that the model-free can be obtained by extending the algorithms introduced in this chapter.</p>
<p>Q: What are model-based and model-free reinforcement learning?<br>A: Although the algorithms introduced in this chapter can find optimal policies, they are usually called <strong>dynamic programming algorithms</strong> rather than reinforcement learning algorithms because they require the system model. Reinforcement learning algorithms can be classified into two categories: model-based and model-free. Here, <strong>model-based does not refer to the requirement of the system model. Instead, model-based reinforcement learning uses data to estimate the system model and uses this model during the learning process.</strong> By contrast, model-free reinforcement learning does not involve model estimation during the learning process.</p>
<h2 id="5-Monte-Carlo-Methods"><a href="#5-Monte-Carlo-Methods" class="headerlink" title="5 Monte Carlo Methods"></a>5 Monte Carlo Methods</h2><p><em>If we do not have a <strong>model</strong>, we must have some <strong>data</strong>. If we do not have data, we must have a model. If we have neither, then we are not able to find optimal policies.</em> The <strong>data</strong> in reinforcement learning usually refers to <strong>the agent’s interaction experiences with the environment.</strong><br>Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms that need do presume system models.<br>Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms that do not presume system models.</p>
<h3 id="5-1-Mean-estimation-problem"><a href="#5-1-Mean-estimation-problem" class="headerlink" title="5.1 Mean estimation problem"></a>5.1 Mean estimation problem</h3><p>we start this chapter by introducing the mean estimation problem, where the expected value of a random variable is estimated from some samples. Understanding this problem is crucial for understanding the fundamental idea of <u> learning from data </u>.<br><strong>Why we care about the mean estimation problem? It is simply because state and action values are both defined as the means of returns. Estimating a state or action value is actually a mean estimation problem.</strong></p>
<p>Consider a random variable $X$ that can take values from a finite set of real numbers denoted as $\mathcal{X}$, suppose that our task is to calculate the mean or expected value of $X$, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[X]$.</p>
<p>Two approaches can be used to calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$.</p>
<p><strong>Model based case</strong></p>
<p>The first approach is model-based. Here, the model refers to the probability distribution of $X$. If the model is known, then the mean can be directly calculated based on the definition of the expected value:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\mathbb{E}[X]=\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) x</script><p><strong>Model free case</strong></p>
<p>The second approach is model-free. When the probability distribution (i.e., the model) of $X$ is unknown, suppose that we have some samples $\left\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\right\}$ of $X$. Then, the mean can be approximated as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\mathbb{E}[X] \approx \bar{x}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n x_j .</script><p>When $n$ is small, this approximation may not be accurate. However, as $n$ increases, the approximation becomes increasingly accurate. When $n \rightarrow \infty$, we have $\bar{x} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}[X]$.</p>
<p>This is guaranteed by the <em>law of large numbers</em>: the average of a large number of samples is close to the expected value.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the samples used for mean estimation must be <strong>independent and identically distributed(i.i.d. or iid)</strong>. Otherwise, if the sampling values correlate, it may be impossible to correctly estimate the expected value. An extreme case is that all the sampling values are the same as the <em>r</em> st one, whatever the <em>r</em> st one is. In this case, the average of the samples is always equal to the <em>r</em> st sample, no matter how many samples we use.</p>
<p><strong>Law of large numbers</strong><br>For a random variable $X$, suppose that $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i=1}^n$ are some i.i.d. samples. Let $\bar{x}=$ $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ be the average of the samples. Then,</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[\bar{x}] & =\mathbb{E}[X], \\
\operatorname{var}[\bar{x}] & =\frac{1}{n} \operatorname{var}[X] .
\end{aligned}</script><p>The above two equations indicate that $\bar{x}$ is an unbiased estimate of $\mathbb{E}[X]$, and its variance decreases to zero as $n$ increases to infinity.<br>The proof is given below.</p>
<p>First, $\mathbb{E}[\bar{x}]=\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^n x_i / n\right]=\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}\left[x_i\right] / n=\mathbb{E}[X]$, where the last equability is due to the fact that the samples are identically distributed (that is, $\mathbb{E}\left[x_i\right]=\mathbb{E}[X]$ ).</p>
<p>Second, $\operatorname{var}(\bar{x})=\operatorname{var}\left[\sum_{i=1}^n x_i / n\right]=\sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{var}\left[x_i\right] / n^2=(n \cdot \operatorname{var}[X]) / n^2=$ $\operatorname{var}[X] / n$, where the second equality is due to the fact that the samples are independent, and the third equability is a result of the samples being identically distributed (that is, $\operatorname{var}\left[x_i\right]=\operatorname{var}[X]$ ).</p>

\end{aligned}</script><p><strong>Under the model free case —— The calculated key is $q_{\pi_k}(s, a)$ ! So how can we calculate $q_{\pi_k}(s, a)$?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Model based case</strong></p>
<p>The policy iteration algorithm is a model based algorithm, the model (or dynamic) is given.  a MDP is composed of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>State transition probability: $p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right)$. </li>
<li>Reward probability: $p(r \mid s, a)$.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, we can calculate $q_{\pi_k}(s, a)$ via following equation</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
q_{\pi_k}(s, a)=\sum_r p(r \mid s, a) r+\gamma \sum_{s^{\prime}} p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right) v_{\pi_k}\left(s^{\prime}\right)</script><p>where  $p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s, a\right)$ and  $p(r \mid s, a)$ are given, and every $v_{\pi_k}\left(s^{\prime}\right)$ is calculated in the PE step.</p>
<p><strong>Model free case</strong></p>
<p>But what if we don’t know the model, Please recalling the definition of action value.</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation} 
q_\pi(s, a) \triangleq \mathbb{E}\left[G_t \mid S_t=s, A_t=a\right]

<p><strong>The procedure of Monte Carlo estimation of action values</strong></p>
<p>Starting from $(s, a)$, following policy $\pi_k$, generate an episode. The return of this episode is $g(s, a)$. $g(s, a)$ is a sample of $G_t$ in</p>

<p>Since policy iteration is convergent, MC Basic is also convergent when given sufficient samples.However, the MC Basic algorithm is not practical due its <strong>low sample efficiency</strong> (we need to calculate $N$ episodes for every $q_{\pi_k}(s, a)$, it is a large work time ).</p>
<p><strong>A simple example</strong></p>
<p>An initial policy is shown in the figure (as you can see, it’s a deterministic policy). Use MC Basic to find the optimal policy. The env setting is: </p>

<p>Outline: given the current policy $\pi_k$, in each iteration:</p>
<ol>
<li>policy evaluation: calculate $q_{\pi_k}(s, a)$. Sicne there’re 9 states and 5 actions. We need to calculate 45 state-action pairs.</li>
<li>policy improvement: select the greedy action</li>
</ol>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
a^*(s)=\arg \max _{a_i} q_{\pi_k}(s, a)</script><p>For each state-action pair, we need to roll out $N$ episodes to estimate the action value. However, since it’s a deterministic policy,  running multiple times would generate the same trajectory. So we only need to rollout  a single episode.</p>
<p>For space limitation, we only illustrate for the part of action value for $s_1$ in the first iteration.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: policy evaluation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Starting from $\left(s_1, a_1\right)$, the episode is $s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} \ldots$ Hence, the action value is</li>
</ol>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
q_{\pi_0}\left(s_1, a_1\right)=-1+\gamma(-1)+\gamma^2(-1)+\ldots</script><ol>

</ol>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
q_{\pi_0}\left(s_1, a_2\right)=0+\gamma 0+\gamma^2 0+\gamma^3(1)+\gamma^4(1)+\ldots</script><ol>

</ol>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
q_{\pi_0}\left(s_1, a_3\right)=0+\gamma 0+\gamma^2 0+\gamma^3(1)+\gamma^4(1)+\ldots</script><ol>
<li>Starting from $\left(s_1, a_4\right)$, the episode is $s_1 \xrightarrow{a_4} s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} \ldots$ Hence, the action value is</li>
</ol>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
q_{\pi_0}\left(s_1, a_4\right)=-1+\gamma(-1)+\gamma^2(-1)+\ldots</script><ol>
<li>Starting from $\left(s_1, a_5\right)$, the episode is $s_1 \xrightarrow{a_5} s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} s_1 \xrightarrow{a_1} \ldots$ Hence, the action value is</li>
</ol>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
q_{\pi_0}\left(s_1, a_5\right)=0+\gamma(-1)+\gamma^2(-1)+\ldots</script><p><strong>Step2: policy improvement</strong></p>
<p>By observing the action values, we see that $q_{\pi_0}\left(s_1, a_2\right)=q_{\pi_0}\left(s_1, a_3\right)$ are the maximum.</p>
<p>As a result, the policy can be improved as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_1\left(a_2 \mid s_1\right)=1 \text { or } \pi_1\left(a_3 \mid s_1\right)=1 \text {. }</script><p>In either way, the new policy for $s_1$ becomes optimal. In this simple example, the initial policy is already optimal for all the states except $s_1$ and $s_3$. Therefore, the policy can become optimal after merely a single iteration. <u>When the policy is nonoptimal for other states, more iterations are needed.</u></p>
<p><strong>A comprehensive example: Episode length and sparse rewards</strong></p>
<p>In MC Basic, if the episode length is too short, the algorithm won’t converge. Its convergence comes from the policy iteration algorithm. But if the episode length is too short, each action value won’t be correct, and the premise of the reasoning falls apart.</p>
<p><strong>So how should we know the right length? Isn’t MC Basic too fragile?</strong></p>
<p>We can see from the following figures that, the episode length greatly impacts the final optimal policies.</p>
<p><strong>When the length of each episode is too short, neither the policy nor the value estimate is optimal</strong> (see Figures 5.4(a)-(d)). In the extreme case where the episode length is one, only the states that are adjacent to the target have nonzero values, and all the other states have zero values since each episode is too short to reach the target or get positive rewards (see Figure 5.4(a)). </p>
<p>As the episode length increases, the policy and value estimates gradually approach the optimal ones (see Fig- ure 5.4(h)).</p>
<p>While the above analysis suggests that each episode must be sufficiently long, the episodes are not necessarily infinitely long. As shown in Figure 5.4(g), when the length is 30, <strong>the algorithm can find an optimal policy, although the value estimate is not yet optimal.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/08/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-model-based-non-incremental/2024-04-23-14-43-23.png" alt="Figure 5.4: a, b, c, d"><br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/08/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-model-based-non-incremental/2024-04-23-14-43-51.png" alt="Figure 5.4: e, f, g, h"></p>
<p>The above analysis is related to an important reward design problem, <strong>sparse reward</strong>, which refers to the scenario in which no positive rewards can be obtained unless the target is reached. <u>The sparse reward setting requires long episodes that can reach the target.</u> This requirement is challenging to satisfy when the state space is large. As a result, the sparse reward problem downgrades the learning efficiency.</p>
<p>One simple technique for solving this problem is to design nonsparse rewards. For instance, in the above grid world example, we can redesign the reward setting so that <strong>the agent can obtain a small positive reward when reaching the states near the target.</strong> In this way, an “attractive field” can be formed around the target so that the agent can find the target more easily<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>initial visit</strong>：an episode is only used to estimate the action value of the initial state-action pair that the episode starts from. The initial-visit strategy merely estimates the action value of $(s_1, a_2)$. The MC Basic algorithm utilizes the initial-visit strategy. However, this strategy is not sample-efficient.because the episode also visits many other state-action pairs such as $(s_2, a_4), (s_2, a_3), (s_5, a_1)$, but they are not be used to estimate the corresponding action values.</p>
<p><strong>subepisode visit</strong>：The trajectory generated after the visit of a state-action pair can be viewed as a new episode.  In this way, the samples in the episode can be utilized more efficiently.</p>
<p>Moreover, a state-action pair may be visited multiple times in an episode. For example, $(s_1, a_2)$ is visited twice in the below episode. If we only count the first-time visit, this is called a <strong>first-visit</strong> strategy. If we count every visit of a state-action pair, such a strategy is called <strong>every-visit</strong> .<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup></p>

This strategy is adopted in the MC Basic algorithm. <strong>The drawback of this strategy is that the agent must wait until all the episodes have been collected before the estimate can be updated.</strong></p>
<p>The second strategy, which can overcome this drawback, is to use the return of a single episode to approximate the corresponding action value. In this way, we can immediately obtain a rough estimate when we receive an episode. Then, <strong>the policy can be improved in an episode-by-episode fashion.(note:this is not step-by-step ,so this is not Temporal-Difference idea)</strong></p>
<p>Since the return of a single episode cannot accurately approximate the corresponding action value, one may wonder whether the second strategy is good. In fact, this strategy falls into the scope of <strong>generalized policy iteration</strong> introduced in the last chapter. That is, <u>we can still update the policy even if the value estimate is not sufficiently accurate.</u></p>

Such techniques can make the algorithm more efficient, but it also makes the algorithm more complex.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/08/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-model-based-non-incremental/2024-04-23-15-13-25.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is worth noting that if an action is not well explored, its action value may be inaccurately estimated, and this action may not be selected by the policy even though it is indeed the best action. Both MC Basic and MC Exploring Starts require this condition. <strong>MC Exploring Starts needs to traverse any one $(s, a)$, that is, it needs to start an episode from any one $(s, a)$.</strong></p>
<p>Exploring starts requires an infinite number of (or sufficiently many) episodes to be generated when starting from every state-action pair. In theory, the exploring starts condition is necessary to find optimal policies. That is, only if every action value is well explored, can we accurately evaluate all the actions and then correctly select the optimal ones.</p>
<p>However, <u>this condition is difficult to meet in many applications, especially those involving physical interactions with environments.</u> Can we remove the exploring starts requirement? The answer is yes, as shown in the next section.</p>

In this way, we do not need a large number of episodes starting from every state-action pair.</p>
<p>One type of common soft policies is $\mathbb{\epsilon}$-greedy policies. An-greedy policy is a stochastic policy that has a higher chance of choosing the greedy action with the greatest action value. and the same nonzero probability of taking any other action.  In particular, suppose that $\mathbb{\epsilon} \in [0,1]$. The corresponding-greedy policy has the following form:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pi_{k+1}(a \mid s)= \begin{cases}1-\frac{\epsilon}{|\mathbb{A}(s)|}(|\mathbb{A}(s)|-1) & \text{for the greedy action} , \\ \frac{\epsilon}{|\mathbb{A}(s)|} & \text{for the other action} |\mathbb{A}(s)|-1 \text{action}.\end{cases} \nonumber</script><ul>
<li>where $|\mathbb{A}(s)|$ denotes the number of actions associated with $s$.</li>
<li>When $\epsilon= 0$ ,$\epsilon$-greedy becomes greedy. When $\epsilon$= 1, the probability of taking any action equals $\frac{1}{|\mathbb{A}(s)|}$.</li>
<li>The probability of taking the greedy action is always greater than that of taking any other action because</li>
</ul>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
1-\frac{\epsilon}{|\mathbb{A}(s)|}(|\mathbb{A}(s)|-1)=1-\epsilon+\frac{\epsilon}{|\mathbb{A}(s)|} \geq \frac{\epsilon}{|\mathbb{A}(s)|}</script><p>for any $\mathbb{\epsilon} \in [0,1]$.</p>

<p>If greedy policies are replaced by $\epsilon$-greedy policies in the policy improvement step, can we still guarantee to obtain optimal policies?<br>The answer is both yes and no. By yes, we mean that, when given sufficient samples, the algorithm can converge to an $\mathbb{\epsilon}$-greedy policy that is optimal in the set $\mathbb{\Pi}_{\epsilon}$. By no, we mean that the policy is merely optimal among all-greedy policies $\mathbb{\Pi}_{\epsilon}$ but may not be optimal in $\mathbb{\Pi}$. However, if $\mathbb{\epsilon}$ is sufficiently small, the optimal policies in are close to those in $\mathbb{\Pi}$.</p>

In this way, all the actions can be visited and evaluated well. Exploitation means that the improved policy should <strong>take the greedy action that has the greatest action value.</strong> However, since the action values obtained at the current moment may not be accurate due to insufficient exploration, we should keep exploring while conducting exploitation to avoid missing optimal actions.<strong>(exploration-exploitation dilemma,EvE )</strong></p>
<p><strong>$\mathbb{\epsilon}$-greedy policies provide one way to balance exploration and exploitation.</strong>  If we would like to enhance exploitation and optimality, we need to reduce the value of $\mathbb{\epsilon}$. However, if we would like to enhance exploration, we need to increase the value of $\mathbb{\epsilon}$.</p>

<h2 id="6-Stochastic-Approximation"><a href="#6-Stochastic-Approximation" class="headerlink" title="6 Stochastic Approximation"></a>6 Stochastic Approximation</h2><p>We use the present chapter to fill this knowledge gap by introducing the basics of stochastic approximation. Although this chapter does not introduce any specific reinforcement learning algorithms, it lays the necessary foundations for studying subsequent chapters. We will see in Chapter 7 that <strong>the temporal-difference algorithms can be viewed as special stochastic approximation algorithms.</strong> The well-known stochastic gradient descent <strong>(SGD)</strong> algorithms widely used in machine learning are also introduced in the present chapter.</p>
<h3 id="6-1-Mean-estimation"><a href="#6-1-Mean-estimation" class="headerlink" title="6.1 Mean estimation"></a>6.1 Mean estimation</h3><p>The basic idea of <strong>Monte Carlo estimation</strong> is:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\mathbb{E}[X] \approx \bar{x}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n x_j .</script><p>as $n$ increases, the approximation becomes increasingly accurate. When $n \rightarrow \infty$, we have $\bar{x} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}[X]$.</p>
<p>We next show that two methods can be used to calculate $\bar{x}$ . The first <strong>non-incremental method</strong> collects all the samples first and then calculates the average. The drawback of such a method is that, if the number of samples is large, we may have to wait for a long time until all of the samples are collected. </p>
<p>The second method can avoid this drawback because it calculates the average in an <strong>incremental manner</strong> Specifically, suppose that:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
w_{k+1} =\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k x_i ,  k=1,2,\dots .</script><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
w_{k} =\frac{1}{k-1} \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i ,  k=2,3,\dots .</script><p>Therefore, we obtain the following <strong>incremental algorithm</strong>:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation}
  w_{k+1} =w_{k}-\frac{1}{k}(w_k-x_k) .
\end{equation}</script><p>The advantage of the incremental algorithm is that the average can be immediately calculated every time we receive a sample. This average can be used to approximate $\bar{x}$ and hence $\mathbb{E}[X]$. Notably, the approximation may not be accurate at the beginning due to insufficient samples. However, it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider an algorithm with a more general expression:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
  \textcolor{red}{w_{k+1} =w_{k}-a_k(w_k-x_k)} .
\end{aligned}</script><p>It is the same as the incremental algorithm except that the coefficient $1/k$ is replaced by $a_k &gt; 0$ However, we will show in the next section that, if $k$ satisfies some mild conditions, $w_k \rightarrow \mathbb{E}[X]$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. In Chapter 7, we will see that temporal-difference algorithms have similar (but more complex) expressions.</p>

<h4 id="6-2-1-Problem-statement"><a href="#6-2-1-Problem-statement" class="headerlink" title="6.2.1 Problem statement"></a>6.2.1 Problem statement</h4><p>Problem statement: Suppose we would like to find the root of the equation</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 g(w)=0</script><p>where $w \in \mathbb{R}$ is the variable to be solved and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function. Many problems can be formulated as root- finding problems. For example, if $J(w)$ is an objective function to be optimized, this optimization problem can be converted to solving $g(w) = \nabla_w J(w) = 0$.</p>
<p>If the expression of $g$ or its derivative is known, there are many numerical algorithms that can solve this problem.However, <strong>the problem we are facing is that the expression of the function g is unknown.</strong> For example, the function may be represented by an artificial neural network whose structure and parameters are unknown. Moreover, we can only obtain a noisy observation of $g(w)$:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation}
 \textcolor{purple} {\tilde{g}(w, \eta)=g(w)+\eta}
\end{equation}</script><p>where $\eta \in \mathbb{R}$ is the <em>observation error</em>, which may or may not be Gaussian. In summary, it is a black-box system where only the input $w$ and the noisy output $\tilde{g}(w, \eta)$ are known. Our aim is to solve $g(w)=0$ using $w$ and $\tilde{g}$.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/09/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-TD-algorithms/2024-04-24-21-31-33.png" alt="Figure 6.2: An illustration of the problem of solving g(w) = 0 from w and g."></p>
<p>The Robbins-Monro (RM) algorithm can solve $g(w)=0$ is </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">

As can been seen, RM algorithm only requires the input ($\left\{w_k\right\}$) and output data ($\left\{\tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right)\right\}$). It does not need to know the expression of $g(w)$. Next we introduce an example to illustrate RM algorithm.</p>
<h4 id="6-2-2-An-illustrative-example"><a href="#6-2-2-An-illustrative-example" class="headerlink" title="6.2.2 An illustrative example"></a>6.2.2 An illustrative example</h4><p><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/09/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-TD-algorithms/2024-04-24-21-40-10.png" alt=""><br>Consider the example shown in Figure. In this example, $g(w)=\tanh (w-1)$, the true root of $g(w)=0$ is $w^\ast=1$. Parameters: $w_1=3, a_k=1 / k, \eta_k \equiv 0$ (no noise for the sake of simplicity) The RM algorithm in this case is $\textcolor{blue} {w_{k+1}=w_k-a_k g\left(w_k\right)} $ since $\tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right)=g\left(w_k\right)$ when $\eta_k=0$. The resulting $\left\{w_k\right\}$ generated by the RM algorithm is shown in Figure . It can be seen that $w_k$ converges to the true root $w^\ast=1$.</p>
<p>This simple example can illustrate why the RM algorithm converges.</p>
<ul>
<li>When $w_k&gt;w^\ast$, we have $g\left(w_k\right)&gt;0$. Then, $w_{k+1}=w_k-a_k g\left(w_k\right)&lt;w_k$. If $a_k g\left(w_k\right)$ is sufficiently small, we have $w^\ast&lt;w_{k+1}&lt;w_k$. As a result, $w_{k+1}$ is closer to $w^\ast$ than $w_k$.</li>

</ul>
<p>In either case,$w_{k+1}$ is closer to $w^\ast$ than $w_k$. Therefore, it is intuitive that $w_k$ converges to $w^\ast$.</p>
<h4 id="6-2-3-RM-algorithm’s-proof"><a href="#6-2-3-RM-algorithm’s-proof" class="headerlink" title="6.2.3 RM algorithm’s proof"></a>6.2.3 RM algorithm’s proof</h4><p>Robbins-Monro theorem: In the Robbins-Monro algorithm $\textcolor{red} {w_{k+1}=w_k-a_k \tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right) ,k=1,2,3,\dots}$, if：<br><em>(a)</em> $0&lt;c_1 \leq \nabla_w g(w) \leq c_2$ for all $w$;<br><em>(b)</em> $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k=\infty$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k^2&lt;\infty$;<br><em>(c)</em> $\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k \mid \mathcal{H}_k\right]=0$ and $\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k^2 \mid \mathcal{H}_k\right]&lt;\infty$;</p>
<p>where $\mathcal{H}_k=\left\{w_k, w_{k-1}, \ldots\right\}$, then $w_k$ almost surely converges to the root $w^\ast$ satisfying $g\left(w^\ast\right)=0$.</p>
<p>The three conditions in previous are explained as follows.</p>
<p><strong><em>Condition (a)</em></strong><br>$0&lt;c_1 \leq \nabla_w g(w)$ indicates that $g(w)$ is a monotonically increasing function. This condition ensures that the root of $g(w)=0$ exists and is unique. If $g(w)$ is monotonically decreasing, we can simply treat $-g(w)$ as a new function that is monotonically increasing.</p>
<p>As an application, we can formulate an optimization problem in which the objective function is $J(w)$ as a root- finding problem: $g(w) = \nabla_wJ(w) = 0$. In this case, the condition that $g(w)$ is monotonically increasing <strong>indicates that $J(w)$ is convex, which is a commonly adopted assumption in optimization problems.</strong></p>
<p>The inequality $\nabla_w g(w) \leq c_2$ indicates that the gradient of $g(w)$ is bounded from above. For example, $g(w)=\tanh (w-1)$ satisfies this condition, but $g(w)=w^3-5$ does not.</p>
<p><strong><em>Condition (b)</em></strong><br>The second condition about $\left\{a_k\right\}$ is interesting. We often see conditions like this in reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
<p>In particular, the condition $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k^2&lt;\infty$ means that $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2$ is bounded from above. It requires that $a_k$ converges to zero as $k \rightarrow \infty$.</p>
<p>The condition $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k=\infty$ means that $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$ is infinitely large. It requires that $a_k$ should not converge to zero too fast. These conditions have interesting properties, which will be analyzed in detail shortly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Condition (c)</em></strong><br>The condition is mild. It does not require the observation error $\eta_k$ to be Gaussian. An important special case is that $\left\{\eta_k\right\}$ is an i.i.d. stochastic sequence satisfying $\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k\right]=0$ and $\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k^2\right]&lt;\infty$. In this case, the third condition is valid because $\eta_k$ is independent of $\mathcal{H}_k$ and hence we have $\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k \mid \mathcal{H}_k\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k\right]=0$ and $\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k^2 \mid \mathcal{H}_k\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\eta_k^2\right]$.</p>
<p><strong><u>Why is the second condition important for the convergence of the RM algorithm?</u></strong></p>
<p>This question can naturally be answered when we present a rigorous proof of the above theorem later. Here, we would like to provide some insightful intuition.</p>
<p>First, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k^2&lt;\infty$ indicates that $a_k \rightarrow 0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. Why is this condition important? Suppose that the observation $\tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right)$ is always bounded. Since </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
w_{k+1}-w_k=-a_k \tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right)</script><p>if $a_k \rightarrow 0$, then $a_k \tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right) \rightarrow 0$ and hence $w_{k+1}-w_k \rightarrow 0$, indicating that $w_{k+1}$ and $w_k$ approach each other when $k \rightarrow \infty$.Otherwise, if $a_k$ does not converge, then $w_k$ may still fluctuate when $k \rightarrow \infty$.</p>
<p>Second, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k=\infty$ indicates that $a_k$ should not converge to zero too fast. Why is this condition important?</p>
<p>Summarizing both sides of the equations of $ w_2-w_1 = -a_1 \tilde{g}\left(w_1, \eta_1\right), w_3-w_2=-a_2 \tilde{g}\left(w_2, \eta_2\right), w_4-w_3=-a_3 \tilde{g}\left(w_3, \eta_3\right), \ldots $ gives </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
w_1-w_{\infty}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k \tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right) .</script><p>If $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k&lt;\infty$, then $\left|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k \tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right)\right|$ is also bounded. But we will show that this can not guarantee the convergence. Let $b$ denote the finite upper bound such that </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation}
\left|w_1-w_{\infty}\right|=\left|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k \tilde{g}\left(w_k, \eta_k\right)\right| \leq b . 
\end{equation}</script><p>If the initial guess $w_1$ is selected far away from $w^\ast$ so that $\left|w_1-w^\ast\right|&gt;b$, then it is impossible to have $w_{\infty}=w^\ast$. This suggests that the RM algorithm cannot find the true solution $w^\ast$ in this case. Therefore, the condition $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k=\infty$ is necessary to ensure convergency given an arbitrary initial guess.</p>
<p><strong><u>An example of $a_k$</u></strong><br>What kinds of sequences satisfy $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k=\infty$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k^2&lt;\infty$ ?</p>
<p>One typical sequence is </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
a_k=\frac{1}{k} .</script><p>On the one hand, it holds that </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}-\ln n\right)=\kappa,</script><p>where $\kappa \approx 0.577$ is called the Euler-Mascheroni constant (or Euler’s constant) . Since $\ln n \rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, we have </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}=\infty</script><p>In fact, $H_n=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}$ is called the harmonic number in number theory [29]. On the other hand, it holds that </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}<\infty .</script><p>Finding the value of $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}$ is known as the Basel problem [30].</p>
<p>In summary, the sequence $\left\{a_k=1 / k\right\}$ satisfies the second condition in Theorem 6.1. Notably, a slight modification, such as $a_k=1 /(k+1)$ or $a_k=c_k / k$ where $c_k$ is bounded, also preserves this condition.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>In the RM algorithm, <strong>$a_k$ is often selected as a sufficiently small constant in many applications.</strong> Although the second condition is not satisfied anymore in this case because $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k^2=\infty$ rather than $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k^2&lt;\infty$, the algorithm can still converge in a certain sense.</p>

To answer this question, we consider the relative error between the stochastic and batch gradients:</p>

As a result, when $\left|w_k-w^\ast\right|$ is large, $\delta_k$ is small. In this case, the SGD algorithm behaves like the gradient descent algorithm and hence $w_k$ quickly converges to $w^\ast$. When $w_k$ is close to $w^\ast$, the relative error $\delta_k$ may be large, and the convergence exhibits more randomness.</p>

<ol>
<li>the new value $v_{t+1}(s_t)$ is closer to $\tilde{v}_t$ than the old value $v_t(s_t)$. Therefore, this algorithm mathematically drives $v_t(s_t)$ toward $\tilde{v}_t$. This is why $\tilde{v}_t$ is called the TD target.</li>
<li>TD error is called temporal-difference because $\delta_t$ reflects the discrepancy between two time steps $t$ and $t + 1$. In addition, the TD error is zero in the expectation sense when the state value estimate is accurate. So the TD error also reflects the discrepancy between the estimate $v_t$ and the true state value $v_{\pi}$.<h4 id="7-1-3-Compare-TD-Learning-with-MC-Learning"><a href="#7-1-3-Compare-TD-Learning-with-MC-Learning" class="headerlink" title="7.1.3 Compare TD Learning with MC Learning"></a>7.1.3 Compare TD Learning with MC Learning</h4>|                                                                                  TD learning                                                                                   |                                                                    MC learning                                                                    |<br>| :——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————: | :———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-: |<br>|                                      <strong>Online</strong>: It can update the state/action values immediately after receiving an experience sample.                                       | <strong>Offline</strong>: It must wait until an episode has been completely collected.

<ul>
<li><strong>The behavior policy</strong> is the one used to generate experience samples.</li>
<li><strong>The target policy</strong> is the one that is constantly updated to converge to an optimal policy. </li>
</ul>
<p>When the behavior policy is the same as the target policy, such a learning process is called on-policy. Otherwise, when they are different, the learning process is called off-policy.</p>
<p>The advantage of off-policy learning is that it can learn optimal policies based on the experience samples generated by other policies, which may be, for example, a policy executed by a human operator. As an important case, <strong>the behavior policy can be selected to be exploratory.</strong> For example, if we would like to estimate the action values of all state action pairs, we must generate episodes visiting every state-action pair sufficiently many times. Although Sarsa uses $\epsilon$-greedy policies to maintain certain exploration abilities, the value of is usually small and hence <strong>the exploration ability is limited</strong>. By contrast, <u>if we can use a policy with a strong exploration ability to generate episodes and then use off-policy learning to learn optimal policies, the learning efficiency would be significantly increased.</u></p>
<p><strong>Sarsa is on-policy.</strong><br>we need samples generated by $\pi$. Therefore, $\pi$ is the behavior policy. The second step is to obtain an improved policy based on the estimated values of $\pi$. As a result, $\pi$ is the target policy that is constantly updated and eventually converges to an optimal policy. Therefore, the behavior policy and the target policy are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Monte Carlo learning is on-policy.</strong><br>A policy is used to generate samples, which is further used to estimate the action values of the policy. Based on the action values, we can improve the policy.</p>
<p><strong>Q-learning is off-policy.</strong><br>The fundamental reason is that Q-learning is an algorithm for solving the Bellman optimality equation that can directly generate the optimal values and optimal policies.we need not to evaluate the associated policy.<br>Q-learning experience sample requires $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1},s_{t+1})$. If $(s_t, a_t)$ is given, then $r_{t+1}$ and $s_{t+1}$ do not depend on any policy!<br>The behavior policy to generate at from $s_t$ can be anything. The target policy will converge to the optimal policy.<br><strong>Note</strong>:  on-policy/off-policy is online/offline learning?<br>Online learning refers to the case where the value and the policy are updated once an experience sample is obtained. Offline learning refers to the case where the update can only be done after all experience samples have been collected(episodes).</p>

This implementation is similar to the Sarsa one in Algorithm 7.1. Here, the behavior policy is the same as the target policy, which is an-greedy policy.</p>
<p>The off-policy version is shown in Algorithm 7.3. The behavior policy $\pi_b$ can be any policy as long as it can generate sufficient experience samples. <strong>It is usually favorable when $\pi_b$ is exploratory</strong>. Here, the target policy $\pi_T$ is greedy rather than $\epsilon$-greedy <strong>since it is not used to generate samples and hence is not required to be exploratory.</strong> Moreover, the off-policy version of Q-learning presented here is implemented offline: all the experience samples are collected first and then processed. It can be modified to become online: the value and policy can be updated immediately once a sample is received.</p>

Here, the ground truth is obtained by the model-based policy iteration algorithm. The ground truth is given in Figures 7.4(a) and (b).</p>
<p><strong>Experience samples</strong>: The behavior policy has a uniform distribution: the probability of taking any action at any state is 0.2 (Figure 7.4(c)). A single episode with 100,000 steps is generated (Figure 7.4(d)). Due to the good exploration ability of the behavior policy, the episode visits every state-action pair many times.</p>
<p><strong>Learned results</strong>: Based on the episode generated by the behavior policy, the final target policy learned by Q-learning is shown in Figure 7.4(e). This policy is optimal because the estimated state value error (root-mean-square error) converges to zero as shown in Figure 7.4(f). In addition, one may notice that the learned optimal policy is not exactly the same as that in Figure 7.4(a). In fact, there exist multiple optimal policies that have the same optimal state values.</p>
<p><strong>Different initial values</strong>: Since Q-learning bootstraps, the performance of the algorithm depends on the initial guess for the action values. As shown in Figure 7.4(g), <u>when the initial guess is close to the true value, the estimate converges within approximately 10,000 steps.</u> Otherwise, the convergence requires more steps (Figure 7.4(h)). Nevertheless, these figures demonstrate that Q-learning can still converge rapidly even though the initial value is not accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Different behavior policies</strong>: <u>When the behavior policy is not exploratory, the learning performance drops significantly.</u> For example, consider the behavior policies shown in Figure 7.5. They are $\epsilon$-greedy policies with = 0.5 or 0.1 (the uniform policy in Figure 7.4(c) can be viewed as $\epsilon$-greedy with = 1). It is shown that, when decreases from 1 to 0.5 and then to 0.1, the learning speed drops significantly. That is because the exploration ability of the policy is weak and hence the experience samples are insufficient.</p>

<h3 id="7-6-A-unified-viewpoint"><a href="#7-6-A-unified-viewpoint" class="headerlink" title="7.6 A unified viewpoint"></a>7.6 A unified viewpoint</h3><p>In this section, we introduce a uni ed framework to accommodate all these<br> algorithms and MC learning.<br>In particular, the TD algorithms (for action value estimation) can be expressed in a unified expression:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{equation}
\textcolor{blue}{q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t) =q_{t}(s_t,a_t)-\alpha_t(s_t,a_t)[q_{t}(s_t,a_t)-\bar{q_t}]}  , \end{equation}</script><p>where $\bar{q_t}$ is the TD target. Different TD algorithms have different $\bar{q_t}$.<br><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2024/08/09/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning-TD-algorithms/2024-05-22-20-00-27.png" alt=""><br>As can be seen, all of the algorithms aim to solve the Bellman equation except Q-learning, which aims to solve the Bellman optimality equation.</p>
<h3 id="7-7-Summary"><a href="#7-7-Summary" class="headerlink" title="7.7 Summary"></a>7.7 Summary</h3><p>we introduced include Sarsa, n-step Sarsa, and Q-learning. All these algorithms can be viewed as stochastic approximation algorithms for solving Bellman or Bellman optimality equations.<br>The TD algorithms introduced in this chapter, except Q-learning, are used to evaluate a given policy. That is to estimate a given policy’s state/action values from some experience samples. Together with policy improvement, they can be used to learn optimal policies. Moreover, these algorithms are on-policy: the target policy is used as the behavior policy to generate experience samples.<br>Q-learning is slightly special compared to the other TD algorithms in the sense that it is o-policy. The target policy can be different from the behavior policy in Q-learning. The fundamental reason why Q-learning is o-policy is that Q-learning aims to solve the Bellman optimality equation rather than the Bellman equation of a given policy.<br>It is worth mentioning that there are some methods that can convert an on-policy algorithm to be off-policy. Importance sampling is a widely used one and will be introduced in Chapter 10. Finally, there are some variants and extensions of the TD algorithms introduced in this chapter <sup><a href="#fn_5" id="reffn_5">5</a></sup>. For example, the $TD(\lambda)$ method provides a more general and uni ed framework for TD learning. More information can be found in paper<sup><a href="#fn_6" id="reffn_6">6</a></sup>.</p>

Silver, Deep reinforcement learning with double Q-learning, in AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 30, 2016.<br><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="reffn_6">6</a></sup>:R. S. Sutton and A. G. Barto, Reinforcement learning: An introduction (2nd Edition). MIT Press, 2018.</p>
<p>Q: What does the term learning in TD learning mean?<br> A: From a mathematical point of view, learning simply means estimation . That is to estimate state/action values from some samples and then obtain policies based on the estimated values.</p>
<p>Q: Why does Sarsa update policies to be-greedy?<br>A: That is because the policy is also used to generate samples for value estimation. Hence, it should be exploratory to generate sufficient experience samples.</p>
<p>Q: While Theorems 7.1 and 7.2 require that the learning rate t converges to zero gradually, why is it often set to be a small constant in practice?<br>A: The fundamental reason is that the policy to be evaluated keeps changing (or called nonstationary). In particular, a TD learning algorithm like Sarsa aims to estimate the action values of a given policy. If the policy is fixed, using a decaying learning rate is acceptable. However, in the optimal policy learning process, the policy that Sarsa aims to evaluate keeps changing after every iteration. We need a constant learning rate in this case; otherwise, a decaying learning rate may be too small to effectively evaluate policies. Although a drawback of constant learning rates is that the value estimate may fluctuate eventually, the fluctuation is negatable as long as the constant learning rate is sufficiently small.</p>
<p>Q: Why does the o-policy version of Q-learning update policies to be greedy instead of $\epsilon$-greedy?<br>A: That is because the target policy is not required to generate experience samples. Hence, it is not required to be exploratory.</p>
<h2 id="Approximation-Q-learning-Steps"><a href="#Approximation-Q-learning-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Approximation (Q-learning Steps)"></a>Approximation (Q-learning Steps)</h2><p>The Q-learning algorithm uses a Q-table of State-Action Values (also called Q-values). This Q-table has a row for each state and a column for each action. Each cell contains the estimated Q-value for the corresponding state-action pair.<br>Steps:</p>
<p>1.We start by initializing all the Q-values to zero. As the agent interacts with the environment and gets feedback, the algorithm iteratively improves these Q-values until they converge to the Optimal Q-values. It updates them using the Bellman equation.</p>
<p>2.Then we use the ε-greedy policy to pick the current action from the current state.</p>
<p>3.Execute this action tointhe environment to execute, and gets feedback in the form of a reward and the next state.</p>
<p>4.Now, for step #4, the algorithm has to use a Q-value from the next state in order to update its estimated Q-value (Q1) for the current state and selected action.</p>
<p>And here is where the Q-Learning algorithm uses its clever trick. The next state has several actions, so which Q-value does it use? It uses the action (a4) from the next state which has the highest Q-value (Q4). What is critical to note is that it treats this action as a target action to be used only for the update to Q1. It is not necessarily the action that it will actually end up executing from the next state when it reaches the next time step. </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Q(s_t, a_t) \gets (1-\alpha)Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left( r_t + (1-d_t) \gamma \max_{a_{t+1}} Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) \right)</script><p> Here $d_t$ is the done flag. If $d_t=1$, then it means the state $s_{t+1}$ is a terminal state. Adding the $\left(1-d_t\right)$ term implies that the discounted return $G_t$ is just going to be $r_t$, since all rewards after that are going to be 0 . In some situations this can help accelerate learning.</p>
<p>In other words, there are two actions involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current action — the action from the current state that is actually executed in the environment, and whose Q-value is updated.</li>
<li>Target action — has the highest Q-value from the next state, and used to update the current action’s Q value.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b) 类的继承与多态</strong>:<br> <strong>继承</strong>：是使用已存在的类的定义作为基础建立新类的技术，新类的定义可以增加新的数据或新的功能，也可以用父类的功能，但不能选择性地继承父类。集成特点如下:</p>
<ol>
<li>父类变，子类就必须变</li>
<li>继承破坏了封装，对于父类而言，它的实现细节对与子类来说都是透明的。</li>
<li>继承是一种强耦合关系</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>多态</strong>：若子类重写了父类中的某些方法，在调用该些方法的时候，必定是使用子类中定义的这些方法（动态连接、动态调用）。实现多态有三个必要条件：继承、重写、调用父类的属性/函数。<br></p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">Fjsp_RMT_singe</span>(<span class="title class_ inherited__">Fjsp_RMT</span>):  <span class="comment"># 继承了 Fjsp_RMT 的属性和功能</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="params">self, job_num, machine_num, p1, p2, parm_data, add</span>):</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment"># 将共用属性的设置导入 File 父类</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">#继承父类super的init参数时属于外部无需self  加入self 会报错</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">super</span>().__init__(job_num, machine_num, p1, p2, parm_data) </span><br><span class="line">        self.add = add</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">get_more_info</span>(<span class="params">self</span>): <span class="comment"># 也可以在子类里复用父类功能</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> self.get_info() + <span class="string">",singe:"</span>+ <span class="built_in">str</span>(self.add)</span><br><span class="line">fjsp_rmt_singe=Fjsp_RMT_singe(<span class="number">4</span>, <span class="number">3</span>, <span class="number">0.3</span>, <span class="number">0.4</span>, [<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">3</span>,<span class="number">4</span>,<span class="number">5</span>],(<span class="number">1080</span>, <span class="number">720</span>))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(fjsp_rmt_singe.get_info())      <span class="comment"># 调用父类的功能</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(fjsp_rmt_singe.p1)              <span class="comment"># 调用父类的属性</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(fjsp_rmt_singe.add)             <span class="comment"># 调用自己的属性</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(fjsp_rmt_singe.get_more_info()) <span class="comment"># 调用自己加工父类的功能</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p></p>

还有一个 try-except-else 的模式，在 else 中处理没有报错的情况。报错情况下不会执行else下的代码，不报错会执行。<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># try-except-else 结构</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">l = [<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">3</span>]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">try</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    l[<span class="number">3</span>] = <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">except</span> IndexError <span class="keyword">as</span> e:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(e)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">"no error, now in else"</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
如果 else 是为了执行没有异常的状况，那么 finally 就是为了执行 不管有没有异常 的情况。无论有报错还是没报错，finally 下面的代码都会运行。<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># try-except-finally 结构</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">l = [<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">3</span>,<span class="number">4</span>]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">try</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    l[<span class="number">3</span>] = <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">except</span> IndexError <span class="keyword">as</span> e:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(e)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">finally</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">"reach finally"</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
上面这两种模式主要用在什么 case 当中呢？你想一下，是不是有些时候，不管你有没有报错，你都想让程序去执行什么。我们甚至都不需要为任何异常做任何处理。 这种时候也就是说，你有异常，我不让你终止主程序，你没有异常吧，万事大吉。<figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">try</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    dddd = dddddd</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">finally</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">"I know there is error, so what?"</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>__iter__ 的意思是，当我在外面 for 循环进行迭代时，我返回什么？在下面例子中，我就把自己这个 class 本身返回回去，继续让自己做迭代就好了。</p>
<p>__next__ 的意思是每次迭代的时候，我的函数会放出来什么元素。下面的功能中实现的就是放出来一个被计算过的 item 元素。<br></p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tbody><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">NeedReturn</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="params">self, init_value=<span class="number">0</span></span>):</span><br><span class="line">        self.tmp = init_value</span><br><span class="line">        self.item = <span class="number">0</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__iter__</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> self</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__next__</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="literal">True</span>:</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">if</span> self.item == self.tmp:</span><br><span class="line">                self.tmp *= <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">return</span> self.item  % 等价于<span class="keyword">yield</span></span><br><span class="line">            self.item += <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">if</span> self.item == <span class="number">300</span>:</span><br><span class="line">                <span class="keyword">raise</span> StopIteration</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> NeedReturn(<span class="number">10</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">print</span>(i)</span><br><span class="line">&gt;&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#10</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#20</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#40</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#80</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#160</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p></p>
<p><strong>装饰器 Decorator</strong> 它是一个装饰 Python Function 的东西。 Function 为什么要被装饰？那就是我们想为这个 Function 做些额外的事情。但是只为一个 Function 做这件事，那我们还不如直接改掉这个 Function，让它直接干这件事就好了。 Decorator 的好处就是，我们可以给批量的 Function 都做这件事。当有一批 Function 都要做些前置或者后置的工作，我们可以统一给他们装修，用一个装饰器统一处理从而减轻你的开发量，特别是针对于不同 function，要做同样的前置处理或后置处理的时候。</p>

<p><strong>（感性认识）Dictionary和package的使用，存储资源等不需要执行诸多种类的程序时采用Dictionary 否则用package</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p> Dictionary在pycharm中是一个文件夹目录，放置资源文件，对应于在进行JavaWeb开发时用于放置css/js文件的目录，或者说在进行物体识别时，用来存储背景图像的文件夹。该文件夹其中并不包含_ _ init.py_ _文件。<br> Python package 包文件夹而言，与Dictionary不同之处在于其会自动创建_ _ init.py_ _ 文件。其包括一组模块和一个 _ _ init.py_ _ 文件。该包的使用与Python的import机制有关，这关乎到你的哪些.py文件是对外可访问的。有些时候，如果一个包下有很多模块，在调用方import如此多模块是很费事，且不优雅的，此时可以通过修改 _ _ init_ _.py来完成该任务。<br>&nbsp;</p>

The authors seem to have included all their results, with the consequence that I am not sure which findings are significant and which are not. However, I also suspect that some contradictory findings have not been included. So although I generally recommend brevity, this should not include leaving out key findings that do not support the authors’ line of logic.</p>
<p>COMMENT2: Rather than highlighting the results that are significant or relevant, the authors have merely repeated in the text everything that they have put in their figures and tables, which seem to include every piece of data that the authors have elaborated in the last three years. This makes for very tedious reading. Moreover, I felt that I was not given the tools to understand for myself the significance of their data.</p>

<p>In my work as a reviewer, I often have difficulty in understanding how significant the authors feel their work is, and why their findings add value. This is because authors are not explicit enough – they don’t signal to<br>me (and the reader) that they are about to say, or are now saying, something important. The result is that their achievement may be hidden in the middle of a nondescript sentence in a nondescript paragraph … and no one will notice it.</p>

    <title>如何优雅的使用 Word 进行论文书写（初级版）</title>
    <url>/cn/2023/12/03/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Word-%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E4%B9%A6%E5%86%99%EF%BC%88%E5%88%9D%E7%BA%A7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="1-多级标题的设置"><a href="#1-多级标题的设置" class="headerlink" title="1. 多级标题的设置"></a>1. 多级标题的设置</h1><blockquote>
<p>构建一个视觉舒服且直观的大纲列表对于开始论文的书写显得格外的重要。而word默认给出的标题样式模板对于书写论文来说太疏松了。本节主要介绍如何自定义一套适合自己的word标题模板。<br>如果对各级标题进行逐个格式化，并为其手动添加序号（如1.1 |第1.1章|第一章 等）就显得不够优雅。有没有一种方式能让我们就像书写markdown一样更加的丝滑那？</p>
</blockquote>
<p>首先，我们新建一个word 对 <code>开始</code>→<code>样式</code>中的我们所预想的格式、字体大小、段落间距等进行预设。<br><strong>主要涉及正文以及标题、1，2，3级标题</strong></p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2023/12/03/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Word-%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E4%B9%A6%E5%86%99%EF%BC%88%E5%88%9D%E7%BA%A7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/titletype.jpg" width="80%" height="50%"></div>


<p><strong>注意</strong> :记着更改各级标题时,每个都要勾选基于该模板的新文档，这样下次新建 word 时直接使用已经更改好的模板即可。</p>
<p><strong>然后就是为各级标题添加序号</strong></p>
<p>进入：<code>开始</code>→<code>多级序号</code>→<code>定义新的多级列表</code> 按需求进行设置即可:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2023/12/03/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Word-%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E4%B9%A6%E5%86%99%EF%BC%88%E5%88%9D%E7%BA%A7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/title.NO.jpg" width="80%" height="50%"></div>

<p><strong>注意</strong> ：为各级标题添加了序号后，实际是把标题样式进行了更新，所以完成编号后需要再次为每个标题进行勾选基于该模板的新文档，不需要改动别的什么直接按  <code>确定</code> 即可，这样下次新建 word 时直接使用已经更改好的带编号的模板了。</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="2-图、表的插入与索引"><a href="#2-图、表的插入与索引" class="headerlink" title="2.图、表的插入与索引"></a>2.图、表的插入与索引</h1><h2 id="2-1-图的题注插入"><a href="#2-1-图的题注插入" class="headerlink" title="2.1 图的题注插入"></a>2.1 图的题注插入</h2><p><strong><em>这一步的前提是 你的标题编号是按上述形式插入的,而非手动写的。这样 word 才能识别你的编号从而插入题注里</em></strong><br>插入图片后  一般选用嵌入式（默认） 右键后选自 <code>插入题注</code> 比如我们想要 <code>图 1.1</code> 新建标签 <code>图</code> 选择编号的格式。示例如下：</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2023/12/03/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Word-%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E4%B9%A6%E5%86%99%EF%BC%88%E5%88%9D%E7%BA%A7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/Fig.jpg  " width="60%" height="50%"></div>

<p>设置好后  在为接下来的插入的图进行题注时 word 会自动识别其应该是<strong>图5还是图6</strong>。无需你在考虑图几，你仅需要输入图的名字即可。</p>
<h2 id="2-2-三线表的插入"><a href="#2-2-三线表的插入" class="headerlink" title="2.2 三线表的插入"></a>2.2 三线表的插入</h2><p>首选插入一个表 然后再 <code>表格样式里选择新建表格样式</code>然后进行如下操作 </p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2023/12/03/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Word-%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E4%B9%A6%E5%86%99%EF%BC%88%E5%88%9D%E7%BA%A7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/table.jpg" width="60%" height="50%"></div>

<p><strong>注意：</strong> <em>记着要勾选基于该模板的新文档，这样下次新建时直接使用已经更改好的三线表了。<br>如果更改后发现没有找到 保存并退出 word 然后重新打开即可看到三线表出现在表格样式里。同样的方法进行表的题注的插入</em></p>
<h2 id="2-3-正文中索引图、表"><a href="#2-3-正文中索引图、表" class="headerlink" title="2.3 正文中索引图、表"></a>2.3 正文中索引图、表</h2><p>选择要插入的位置，点击功能栏 <code>插入下的交叉引用</code> 可进行如图操作</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2023/12/03/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Word-%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E4%B9%A6%E5%86%99%EF%BC%88%E5%88%9D%E7%BA%A7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/index.jpg" width="60%" height="50%"></div>

<p> <strong>注：</strong> <em>当我们插入新图后，图的序号发生改变但是插入正文中的索引未变 ，不要慌 此时我能只需要更新插入引用的域即可 全选后按F9 更新全文的域</em></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="3-MathType-的编号、索引"><a href="#3-MathType-的编号、索引" class="headerlink" title="3. MathType 的编号、索引"></a>3. MathType 的编号、索引</h1><p>目前仅可以逐项公式的编号，即点击 <code>MathType下的右编号</code>在弹出的编辑器里输入公式 会自动的公式居中以及右侧编号。(目前还没有找到为已存在的公式进行编号的方法)</p>
<p>编号的格式可以在 <code>插入编号--格式化</code>里进行更改，选用带章节不带章节的格式以及采用何种连字符等<br>正文索引是也较为方便 点击 <code>插入引用后双击公式编号即可</code>  当你删除公式时编号会自动的更新。</p>
<p>公式的批量大小设置 在编辑器对公式的大小进行定义后</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://www.huangm.cn/cn/2023/12/03/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E4%BC%98%E9%9B%85%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Word-%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E4%B9%A6%E5%86%99%EF%BC%88%E5%88%9D%E7%BA%A7%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/mathtypesize.jpg" width="70%" height="50%"></div>

<li><p>去除endnotes 中的域 （不让其跳转，使之固定以便修改参考文献格式）<br>去除word中因使用mendeley或endnote等文献管理软件而产生的域代码。<br>%CTRL+A 全选文章；<br>%CTRL+6 去除全文域代码。</p>
</li>
<li><p>使用：CTRL+SHIFT+F9（Fn+F9）：去除选中的单个域代码，注不能跨页，有时候多选时也可能不生效，所以当参考文献留一篇索引版  ，然后边选中边去除域，去除完毕后 复制一份参考文献，然后更新参考目录  应为空才算去除完全，把刚刚复制的粘贴上，修改格式。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>注意:</strong> 中途不能更新参考目录  ，如果更新了会将未去除域的参考文献索引重新编排。</p>

<p><font color="#428BCA" size="5"><strong>初衷</strong></font>:<br>IPDS问题涉及生产和配送两个阶段的优化。单独来说，生产调度或配送调度的科学研究时间较长，有丰富的基准案例数据集以及优秀的求解算法。<strong>然而，生产与配送集成调度的研究却在基准案例数据集这方面显得相对匮乏</strong>。出于对该问题的复杂性和特殊性的考虑，大部分研究采用随机生成（或部分随即生成）测试实例的方式进行数值实验，但很少有研究将其测试数据集公布出来以供其他研究者使用和验证。为了给相同或者相近的研究提供统一评价对比和度量的基准，我们将所使用的数据集进行公布，以供其他研究者使用，从而方便其进行数值实验对比工作。</p>
